I live in Myanmar and as you may have heard, my country is in chaos, and all local banks are closed at this moment. With all incoming sanctions from the west, I guess the economy won't be doing well for the next few years. I have some savings worth $20,000 so I'm considering investing half of it in stocks. I've been following stock markets for a year and I guess I know where to invest.
Unfortunately, I'm from Myanmar and living in Myanmar, I can't make any brokerage account due to sanctions on Myanmar from the west as there's no Myanmar in Region/Country option in any brokerage sites. And also, Myanmar's mobile numbers aren't usable either.
But I have a close friend living in China. I'm trying to use his China's mobile numbers and I'll choose ''China'' as Region/Country in creating a brokerage account. I'll be using the zip code number of where he lives. I'm also planning to live in China once all this covid-19 stuff over. So I guess choosing ''China'' will be fine.
As for the bank's cards for my brokerage account, I'll be using my VISA card which linked to Myanmar local bank. Can this be possibly done because I choose ''China'' as my country?
What are the best brokerage apps for non-US citizens especially people from a sanctioned country like Myanmar? What are the monthly fees for using the app? I'm thinking about making an Interactive Brokers Account atm. Are there better options out there? What are the tips for beginners like me?
Any helpful advice is very appreciated. Thanks, guys!",,

I’m a beginner investor, I’ve been dabbling in the markets since I was 19 but I’m still only 23 and have a lot to learn. I have the most money in the market now than I’ve ever had by far, but nothing I can’t afford to lose. I’ve been interested in how investors like Nassim Taleb and Michael Burry made money off of their pessimism, and I myself have started to hedge with deep weekly OTM puts on ETFs like SPY and QQQ (about 10-15% OTM). 
I’ve read plenty of comparisons to the dotcom bubble and it made me wonder if my strategy would even work in a crash. In the dotcom crash, SPY mostly traded sideways, the Nasdaq took a greater hit since that’s where the most overvaluation was. How do I know in the next crash that SPY and QQQ don’t both trade sideways and my puts don’t print? I’ve also taken notice of the worst drops at the start of crashes on a weekly basis, since by the time we’re already down 30% as a market puts will be too expensive to make my strategy worth it, I need to catch the start of the crash. To me it seemed like a reasonable expectation for the beginning of a crash would be a 5-6% weekly drop in SPY or QQQ. But is there a better way to do this? Would buying puts on RUT be better given its recent outperformance? I guess I just want to make sure that if I’m throwing away small amounts of money on expiring puts weekly that I’m doing it for a reason and that my strategy could theoretically pay off if the bubble popped.

I'm really new to options trading and I have a question. I've noticed that a lot of deep ITM options tend to have a break even that is below the current share price. It seems like an obvious strategy would be to buy these options and immediately exercise them and then sell the shares right back for a profit. It seems like it's essentially free money as long as you can cover the upfront cost. As we all know free money isn't a thing, so what's the catch?",,

However I have no clue how to go about doing that at all. I know there are title companies involved, home inspections, appraisals, and getting a mortgage. Going about doing that I have no clue. 
I make about 85k a year salary and I am single. The house I'm looking at is someone I know who is moving. They are looking for around 80k for it. We are thinking of doing a personal transaction with no realtors to save money.  I have have only been in the labor force about 4 years now so I don't have much saved up. Most was going towards debt. 
I have recently paid off a 23k auto loan and a 5k credit card and still have 35k left in student loans. I have 15k in a regular checking/savings account and about 40k in a 401k. At the end of the year if the company forecasts hold I will get a 20% salary bonus which would work out to be around 17k split over December and February. I am just concerned that if I pull out most of my liquid savings I'll be without any sort of emergency fund until the end of year bonus that is not guaranteed. This past years bonus for 2020 was only $200.25. 
Where should I start to initiate the buying process? How large should my down payment be? Should I borrow funds from my 401k to help with a larger down payment? State is in a very rural part of North Carolina if that helps with first time homebuyers. 
Are there programs that help with first time buyers or am I on my own here. I'm just tired of paying $700 in rent at a place I can't even have a cat. Any advice people here can give or point to a more appropriate sub would be great.",,

After everything that happened and all of the information that came to light about Robinhood  I decided to transfer my brokerage account to Webull from RH. 
I just finished with that process today and finally see my stocks in WeBull after 7 long business days. That said, when I went to check in on them and see their progress after not being able to see them for the past week, I saw that all of my partial partial that I had held in RH dis not transfer into Webull, as well as 4-5 of my positions have not transferred over. 
That’s not a huge deal, as Webull said that some stocks may take longer to transfer but these irregulaties combined with the fact that my account balance is a full $1.5k lower than when I started the transfer and my cash balance is $100 less has me worried (Webull stated they would take care of $75 of transfer fees with a transfer of over $2,000).
I know Webull does not support partial stocks, but I assumed they would have converted the partial stocks into cash on the transfer. 
All that said, has anybody gone through this process? If so is this something I need to start remedying with Webull now? Is this something that will get taken care of in time? Or is this going to be an expensive learning experience?
TL:DR Transferred my brokerage account from RH to Webull and am missing partial stocks and cash balance. Was wondering if anybody has experience and/or advice on how to fix this?",,

Im 25, living in France, and I'd love to invest in American ETFs, stocks, funds ... but most brokers take a bit fee for currency exchange, there are bigger total taxes, and also the less up-to-date stock data.
I was thinking of opening an account in an American bank such as Stanley Morgan, BofA ... and then opening a Webull account so I can trade without worrying about double taxes or currency exchange, and also I like Webull from what I've seen.

Can anyone confirm if this is a valid plan?
Can anyone recommend a bank?
Is it enough to open a Webull account or would I need a SSN?

Thanks guys",,

I have a question regarding opportunities to invest.
I have a role in a market risk team  within a bank that is active in the world of global financial markets. We focus on assessing risks on various stock markets. Due to a confidentiality clause in my contract I am prohibited to privately trade on the stock market. However, the pay i receive is very good and (partially due to the pandemic) i have been able to save up a serious amount this year and i am looking to exhibit my knowledge on business and finance to invest.
I was wondering if you guys have any directions for someone like me to start investing privately. I was personally leaning towards start-up investing, in particular FinTech companies as i have some knowledge regarding that industry. Any tips/advice would be very helpful.   
Fortunately I have 0 debt, my rent is extremely low and i can invest up untill 30k  without breaking. My risk tolerance is on about 50-60% meaning i do not mind risk but im not completely blackjack on the situation.  
Thanks in advance!",,

My question is, is there anything else I can do in that period of time that’s low risk but might help with the performance of my savings?",,

So I received my Tax Report from ETrade today and I am really confused. I track every transaction I make on a separate spreadsheet, and these numbers on the tax report make no sense to me.
So I traded stock XYZ, and during a bunch of selling on and off this summer I lost $601.19. I have that exact number when I add up my buys and sells in my spreadsheet.
However, on ETRADE, it has that -$601.19 as my 'Total Gain,' and then further down under Deferred Loss, it has a total of -$2548.89. I do not understand how this number was calculated and what the significance of this is. When I go to the Tax Report, it says that under this stock I lost the total of (2548.89+601.19)= $3150.08. But again, my account balance did not go down $3k during all these transactions, but just the $600 or so. After some researching, I believe it has something to do with the wash sale rule. But I wasn't trying to hide my tax losses when I kept buying and selling it, if nothing else this makes me look as though I had a worse year than I actually did.
Can someone please explain this situation? I know that I didn't magically lose $2.5k because my transactions and bank account don't reflect that. So why does my tax report?
Thanks for any help!",,

Where should I start to initiate the buying process?

Just go to your bank and tell them and they'll handle most of the work and tell you what you need to do. It would be a good idea to take a look at interest rates for banks to try to get the best rate. The bank will handle the appraisal, the only thing you'll probably have to do is hire the inspector. Either they say the house is good and you have peace of mind or they say the house needs things and you can try to have the seller fix them or knock money off so you can.
For the amount of money you're making that house is dirt cheap, I just paid 80k for my house and the mortgage is only $500 a month and I'm not making nearly as much as you.

Are there programs that help with first time buyers or am I on my own here

If you qualify for First Time Buyer grants then your bank will apply them to your loan, that's how it worked for me anyways.

How large should my down payment be?

The more you put down the better you'll be in the long run but don't go broke doing it. I personally didn't have to put any money down on my house.

Should I borrow funds from my 401k to help with a larger down payment?

I wouldn't do that personally, I would just pay as much as you can a month to try to pay it off early.",,

I recommend starting with a credit union that services mortgages. The lender will lay out all the requirements and pre-approve you for up to a certain amount, and they will order the appraisal once you have a purchase contract hammered out, so don’t worry about orchestrating that process. FHA loans are a good option for first time buyers, as they can secure a home with the lowest down payment. If, for some reason, you go with a conventional loan, plan on a 20% down payment to avoid paying property mortgage insurance (PMI). If you can’t avoid paying PMI, you can always refinance when you have reached 20% equity in the home, BUT BEWARE if rates go up, you may not be any better off, AND you will be starting the clock on a new mortgage along with paying closing costs again... it makes most sense to take advantage of rock bottom rates now, avoid PMI, and ride the loan out. In terms of length of loan, 15 20 or 30 year loan? Depends on what type of person you are. Some people love to be debt free sooner, but it is important to understand (and counterintuitive) that mortgage debt has the power to GROW YOUR WEALTH. This works by borrowing the present value and getting the asset now (hopefully it appreciates over time too) and making payments with future dollars which are worth less due to inflation, complimented by your increased earnings as you progress in your career. If you have extra money, invest rather than paying down the cheapest debt you’ll ever see; the compounding yield of investments will far outpace the interest on your mortgage. One caveat, if you have any high interest debt, pay that down before investing. With this in mind, pay the smallest down payment possible and keep as much of your money invested as you can. 
Now, how to seal the deal? You can contact a real estate attorney and ask how much they will charge to draft a contract and walk you through the rest of the process to closing, but considering everything you have described, I think it’s best to contact a real estate agent to have him/her serve as a “transactional agent” in which they facilitate everything involved and do not represent/advocate for either the buyer or seller. This should be 3% or less of the sale price, you can offer to pay for it or split the cost. Generally, the default is for the seller to pay both realtors, but you’ll be hiring just one, and if you want the seller to have the $80K, just bump up the sale price to offset this cost and roll it into the loan, you’ll never notice such a marginal increase in your bill. 
It is very important that you do get a home inspection and meet the inspector so that he can show you everything (like specific issues, where water/gas shutoffs are etc) and ask all the questions/concerns you have. If major problems are discovered, your purchase contract should have an “inspection resolution deadline” in which you guys can either renegotiate price or the seller agrees to fix the issue or a combination of both, or kill the deal. 
Also, if you casually shop around on the internet for real estate interest rate calculators, keep in mind that only describes the loan, it does not include insurance, yearly taxes, or PMI. The online calculators describe unrealistically low mortgage payments. Your ACTUAL mortgage payment includes and coordinates everything within one bill. 
Hope this is clear and helpful. Best of luck!",,

Most people on here will agree and say no bonds. However, most of those people haven’t experienced a multi year bear market before (nor have I). More of the OG investors will say bonds are there to prevent you from selling out during a crash. 
When it comes to what you should invest in. That’s entirely up to you, your goals and your mindset/gut. Warren Buffett will tell you that investing has nothing to do with how smart you are but rather your ability to tune out noise and stay invested. You have to believe in what you’re investing in. If you just invest in something because a Reddit user told you to, when that thing drops 20% you’re more likely to sell because you don’t know the reason why you bought it to begin with. 
So my advice would be do your own research. Ask yourself how involved you want to be in your investments. Your knowledge level. Your risk tolerance. And go from there. 
What I mean by risk tolerance is: You have 12k now, what will you do when that turns into $5k and is in the red for 3+ years? What if that 12k corrects 30% in less than a month, are you going to panic sell? You can’t sell when that happens. You have to keep buying, buy low sell high.",,

It was a shitty company (for investing purposes) before the pandemic, it got shittier when it became a meme stock, and it won't turn around by pixie dust magic. Sell and put it in something productive. Like paying debt or something that actually will do well in the long term.
As for taxes, assuming the tax code remains the same: Use a tax-advantaged account if you can (IRA, 401K). If not, you pay taxes on any profit you make. You buy something for $100 and sell it $110, you pay a part of the $10 gain to Uncle Sam.
How much you pay depends on mainly two things:

How long have you held the stock
How much money do you make overall

If you hold a stock for more than a year, you usually pay ""long term capital gains"" tax rate which can be 0, 15 or 20% based on #2 (prob. 15 for you).
If you hold it less than a year, then any gains are taxed at your ""ordinary income"" rate, like your salary. That rate is probably 22-24% for you.
Dividends are taxed similarly.
You might also have to pay NIIT (3.8%) and state taxes based on where you live and how much you make. If you lose money on a trade, it gets a bit complicated. See a tax advisor or read up on it. Actually do that regardless.",,

I'm waiting for the Q4 earnings release because, based upon some of the news they've put out, I really think they're going to show a quarterly profit - which I believe would be a first.
If they do, it gives me confidence that they may have finally figured things out and turned the corner, while still having a huge opportunity for future growth.  So with a quarterly profit, I think we could see $7-$10 in the next 12 months (barring a full market meltdown) and $30-$50 in 5-10 years (but really, who knows what the limit could be over that long term if they really get their shit together).  So if they report a profit, I'm holding for the long term.
But, if I'm wrong, and they report the typical loss, then they may be back to the same old IZEA.  The only difference being that they have $30 million cash to play with right now - which, even with a loss, would give me some hope.  It would really depend upon the details on the call and in the release.
So a reported loss leaves me somewhere between cutting my position and hoping for the future, or cashing out and waiting for a better entry point down the road.",,

Imagine what they'll do when the handcuffs are taken off.  In the meantime, they've opened a whole new business - Disney+ - that is essentially NetFlix inside of Disney.
My thoughts from another post a couple days ago:
Disney's market cap is about $340B. Netflix is about $260B - so not a huge difference.
Netflix has around 200 million subscribers and transitioned from mailing out DVDs to streaming in 2007 (14 years ago). Disney+ has just shy of 100 million subscribers and launched in November 2019 (14 months ago). I see no reason that Disney+ can't or won't duplicate Netflix's content library, plus have all the Lucasfilms, Marvel and Disney animation content on top of it.
To me, that means that in 5 years, possibly 8-10, Disney+ will have replaced Netflix as the default streaming service (which is still a growing industry as cord-cutting continues). Disney has gotten half as many subscribers in 14 months as NFLX got in 14 years. I don't know when Disney will pass them, but I wouldn't be shocked if it's less than 3 years from now. And once they've got critical mass, they can gradually raise their rates to NFLX levels.
So in a nutshell, my opinion is that you're essentially going to have a NFLX inside of DIS within 5 years. And if NFLX is worth 75% of DIS today, then what is DIS worth when they've got a streaming service that is beating NFLX?
You couple that with the parks, ESPN, cruise line, ABC, movie studios, and all the other shit that Disney owns and I think you've got a big winner for a long-term hold over the next decade. Is it going to 10X and be a $3.5 Trillion company a decade from now? Doubtful. But is it going to go up consistent with little risk of significant decline? Yeah, I'm pretty confident of that.",,

Foreign ordinary shares (end in F) do get charged significant fees to trade at some brokerages - I've seen fees as high as $50 in some cases (which is ridiculous) so ask your broker first before buying.
ADRs (end in Y) do charge minor fees. A lot of ADRs are a ratio of the original shares - for example, you may see a case of 2 ADRs = one ordinary. You can find out more information about ADRs (including ratios for each ADR) at the JP Morgan-run adr.com
Sometimes you will run into OTC foreign shares that barely trade or that don't trade at all (no bid/ask) Sometimes there is no OTC option for a foreign company. If something barely trades or especially if there isn't an option, you can look to buy on the home/foreign market via Fidelity or other brokerages that offer global trading.
If you see an OTC option for a foreign stock that has decent-to-significant volume (to offer a random example, something like Tencent or LVMH), that should be fine. If it's a foreign ordinary (symbol ends in F), just be sure to ask your broker to make sure there's not a fee for foreign ordinary share trading.
You might have to call for approval for global trading (trading on foreign markets) if you go that route.",,

most of my major plays,  I've been taking profits on and I dont see many buying opportunities currently. Im also a little bearish on the market but overall I feel like I dont understand the big picture rn. 
For me its a great time to have more cash on hand and learn cheap lessons. I feel like if I lost all my money in my high risk account I would end up learning lessons worth more than the total acc rn.
In terms of learning I feel like in the past year or so I've learned my biggest lessons on losses. Im still going to try and mitigate losses not embrace them but I do value them
I think it is a very low chance of winning especially when it comes to chances of the stock being ITM at expiration, but I do believe in buying low implied volatility and selling high implied volatility 
I really appreciate your input alot,  but I think the small chance it has of winning, carries a huge upside when my other accounts are so consverative.

No, because you should be able to sell the warrants at any time (just like selling an option you purchased).  What are the bid/ask on the warrants now.  If it's still near $18, just sell them and get a do-over.
There's nothing worse that being in a trade that you don't understand.  Fortunately, in this trade, your loss is limited to $3,600 so you know what your absolute worst-case downside is.  But if you can get out and get your money back, it's just a cheap lesson to not enter into trades that you you don't know what you're doing.",,

wouldn't it seem that in the long run you would actually be SUCCESSFUL if you went in the opposite direction?

No.
I understand what you are saying, but you don't seem to understand that it isn't any different of an investment thesis. If you aren't doing research and betting on directionality of the move, it is a 50/50 guess either way you go.
If you do research, have a sound thesis for why you are buying with entry and exit strategies, that is an actual plan that isn't a 50/50 gamble. 
Even with really good research you are going to be wrong sometimes. That is where the exit strategy, risk parity, etc come in to play.
Your concept of inversing your gut is based on a false premise and gambling, not investing.",,

It’s fluctuating between $28-31 today, when earnings were supposedly made public for the first time. The consistent downward movement from $38 last Monday down to $31 Friday was a lot more significant than the “dip” we are seeing today post-earnings. 
It almost feels like the mediocre earnings are priced in at this point given performance last week, and that maybe last week’s dip was based on premature knowledge of the earnings report. Not sure what other publicly facing information would lead to such a significant dip while legitimate “negative” PR from today’s earnings shows a much smaller impact. As usual, PLTR announces good news (last week’s IBM contract is the latest example) and then the stock goes red, lol. 
Personally I think the stock might continue to dip after lockup expires. I’m bullish long term but this could be painful for a while. I’ll likely increase my position if it closes in around $25 and then not look at it again for 3 years lol. While insiders likely understand how valuable PLTR can be long term there could be a strong incentive to take cash now and leverage it elsewhere in this infinite bull market rather than sit on a bunch of PLTR shares that might not print for another 3+ years.",,

You saw it in AAPL in the aughts, or more recently TSLA. Some people had the right reasons for making those investments, but many many more had bad reasons and still get those validated over and over from essentially a lucky pick. It’s a Pavlovian response... “make bad arguments and rationalizations for an emotional pick —> price keeps going up —> I must be a genius and anyone who argues against my brilliant and gains validated choice is just a hater who deserves downvotes”.
Obviously I’m not making an equivalence between PLTR and those other picks, just the fact that those who picked it for bad reasons need to spend some time in the wilderness once their holy grail stumbles. If it doesn’t, they will continue to get worse and more annoying. If it does keep going up you see fanboyism distilled to a science after blind devotion to the company led to many of the most devout followers actually getting life changing gains and “rewarding” that success with even more fervent blind devotion.",,

If a bunch of people want to buy something, price goes up. They only realize value by selling, though, so then the price will go down. 
When market cap of something is fantastically higher than its conceivable value and the price keeps going up... I know someone is making a lot of money, but they're not making it from the company. They're making it from other people who bought or sold at the wrong time. I don't trust myself not to be one of those people, so... boring, value investing for me.

As much as everyone who’s bullish thinks no one at Palantir will be selling stocks in volume, I’d question the likelihood of us not seeing significant sales volume off the back off this. Even those that really believe in the company and where it’s going are likely to want to realise some nice profits on a percentage of their holdings.
The only risk in waiting to see how lock up plays out (eg if driven down significantly) is that you may miss the current drop / dip, and if lock up expiry doesn’t lead to a larger sell off, find that the stock continues quickly upwards - leaving you to get in higher.
I sold for a profit at the start of the drop. I’ll look to get back in post lock up, if the price ends up back around what I originally paid (mid 20s).",,

A) bullish on PLTR and looking for an entry point, I'd wait until Friday. Maybe buy some positions now, in case the dip Friday doesn't actually bring it lower than today, but I wouldn't do more than half.

3% inflation would be fine. Have some exposure to commodities/producers if you don't already.

You're acting like Reddit was wrong about the yield curve. Look again!
We had the first yield curve inversions around January 2019. We had a stock market crash in February 2020, which follows the historical pattern perfectly. By March 2020 the yield curve was steep again, and stocks shot up. Yield curve inversion remains nearly 100% accurate at predicting recession.
This is from an Email I sent my friend:

It’s been said that bond trading is dominated by institutions, and long-term bond yields say “this is an illusion.” We keep getting closer to yield curve inversion … maybe another year before that happens? Then historically you’ve got maybe one year further before things collapse. It was a good indicator to predict dotcom bubble and subprime mortgage crisis.
So my bet is on two years. We’ve got two years before shit hits the fan.

It depends on why people are continuing to purchase equity at high prices.
Do people really think right now that there is no risk and “stinks inly gi ip?” Well some do, but I don’t think most do. As a result, it’s not irrational faith that ignores risk thats driving valuations.
Rather, there’s just nothing else for people with money to do with their money. Are people going to invest in bonds? Which yield nothing and have their own issues currently? Treasuries? Gold? Cash? Etc. Equity looks like the best option.

I would also add that there are other reasons for high valuations right now such as:

Perceived safety of US investments in time of international crisis
Asset inflation, especially in the US (and Americans then invest in American countries preferentially due to home country bias).
US currency devaluation (probably only 5-10%) due to monetary policy.

I don't think we can blame these high valuations entirely on irrational exuberance.",,

First thing - can't really compare ARK ETFs to Mutual funds. Apples to Oranges.

There's several layers of misconception here.  For one ETF vs Mutual Fund is a difference in legal structure, not strategy, return, cost, whatever.  It's just legal structure. 
Secondly, your post seems to have an implicit assumption that ""mutual fund"" means active, which it does not.  The largest and most popular mutual funds in the world are almost exclusively passive funds. 
Anyway, ARK is an active fund, so if I wanted to make a straight comparison I would go ahead and compare it to two things.  
1) The benchmark, the correct benchmark.  So some sort of passive tech/growth heavy index.
2) other active funds pursuing a similar strategy.",,

I keep reading about ARK growing too fast and get concerned.

The concern IMO is everything growth (the growth-ier the better) is very crowded. You can see the flows into the Morgan Stanley funds subadvised by Centerpoint, the Zevenbergen funds and other funds that were up around 100% or 100%+ last year.  Personally, this is the kind of stuff I'm trimming at this point rather than doubling down on after the kind of unbelievable year growth had last year.

For Metromile to beat them they need to find a way to structurally reduce their expense base as % of premium to pass on savings to customers. 
Even assuming that all of Metromile's costs are fixed (which they aren't) the scale required for them to even approach those expense ratios is pretty ridiculous tbh 
On top of that, regulators require carriers to have premium equal to roughly 3x book value. If they keep losing so much money they're gonna need to raise equity to even be allowed to grow w/o running into capital constraints - assuming their costs are 100% fixed they need to grow premium significantly to be profitable and iirc they don't have capital base to support that level of premium unless IPO gave them a bunch of $ (but this is something to check out before you decide to invest)",,

Additionally, Warren Buffett uses Return on Total Capital (ROTC) as a checks and balance for ROE calculations.  To help those of you that are interested in this formula, it’s calculated as follows:
ROTC = Operating Income/(Short-Term Debt + Long-Term Debt+Shareholder’s Equity). 
As the OP stated, companies can manipulate their Shareholder’s Equity to attract investors filtering by that metric alone. They can do this in many ways such as using debt for stock buybacks; thus, shrinking the capital structure of Shareholder’s Equity.

For ex., you state:

Those two hypothetical companies may have the same exact ROA but company A may just have borrowed heavily, which will jack up ROE. No change in business model, operations, efficiency, etc, just a simple increase in debt will make your ROE go up, even if you just sit on the cash and don't use it.

But, if the enterprise achieved the same return on its asset with higher leverage, I as an equity holder am strictly better off (all else equal). In this sense, ROE is fundamentally useful for public equity investors.
The rest of your argument seems to talk about how ROE isn't capital-structure agnostic, which is true. It's not really a secret though. Just like equity returns aren't capital structure agnostic, or equity volatilities, or cost of equity (via Beta), etc... anything involving purely equity depends on the other participants who are earlier in the cap stack. You should spread several metrics for each comp anyways, so ROE should always be viewed contextually next to leverage levels. If the investor isn't comfortable with the risk of default, then the high yield isn't worth it.
Tl;dr ROE has never been a capital-structure agnostic stat, but it can still be a useful one.",,

For companies which raise capital mostly through debt (think infrastructure companies) you instead want to look at ROIC.
Both of these measures are only really useful for highly capital intensive companies (like financials of infrastructure type companies).

Great post. 
I think this is actually fairly applicable to bank stocks though: Given a bank can boost (or decrease) their earnings/ROE by increasing (or decreasing) the Loans to Deposits ratio of that bank, which in banking is akin to financial leverage (e.g. - if a bank puts more capital (deposits) at risk by lending them out it'll earn more money than they would just sitting in bonds/treasuries/or at the Fed which improves their ROE [unless their underwriting is bad or their borrowers get hit by an economic downturn]).",,

Your statement's description of ROE compared to Investopedia definition seem to contradict each other.
ie, you said ""another way to define ROE as"" ROA x Financial Leverage.
Yet the term ""leverage"" implies debt, yet Investopedia's description (below and linked here) of ROE implies the subtraction of debt in the process of calculating a company's ROE.
If this is the case, the subtraction of that debt (read leverage) should remove the deceiving skew of the metric you described as ROE.   
Using debt is a lot less efficient than using equity and hence why I thought ROE was a good metric.
Unless you are saying the ROE metric you actually see tied to investments isn't the same ROE metric described by Investopedia's ROE page. 
Now, I would say ROA could be more deceiving (in the grand scheme of things) since an asset is an asset is an asset.  Whether you own an asset through the use of leverage, or you own it outright. (paid)  Obviously, a leveraged asset is less profitable than a leverage free asset since one you pay interest on and the other you do not.
Thanks for any response / clarification.

What Is Return on Equity (ROE)?
Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is considered the return on net assets. ROE is considered a measure of the profitability of a corporation in relation to stockholders’ equity.",,

Put in another perspective: Let's say your a private wealth manager for high net-worth clients, and Steve Carell is you client. If you tell Steve Carell that you invested his money in ultra-safe Swiss bonds that yield -1%, he'll probably not be you client anymore.

If this is the case, the subtraction of that debt (read leverage) should remove the deceiving skew of the metric you described as ROE.

This is not true -- in fact it is the opposite. Recommend setting up a quick Excel calc to prove this to yourself: two companies, same P&L (except for interest expense), but one company has leverage and the other doesn't. Calculate both ROEs.

Using debt is a lot less efficient than using equity and hence why I thought ROE was a good metric.

Can someone explaine me pls, i am a little bit confuse. If you borrowed money, your cash increased, so your current assets go up, but simultaneously your debt increased , so your liabiltities inscreased too. And your shareholders equity remains the same. Why should your ROE increased after that ?  
If you increase your debt and have a lot of % payment it will reduce your net income and reduce your ROE. ROE = Net income/ shareholders equity. Maybe i am missing something important here.",,

I had to grind for four years after graduation before I landed my career job, but at least I made it - I'm glad you did, too!
The best resource I came across that motivated me to begin investing was the Investing for Dummies book. That gave me enough of a grounding to feel comfortable buying in to my first mutual fund. I ended up losing a little bit on that investment, but not much. Then I got in to ETFs, learned how to make more strategic purchases (using limit orders, looking for intra-day lows, and the most difficult part: waiting to buy if the price just seems too high), and critically for my investment strategy - making sure to buy before the ex-dividend date (if otherwise an appropriate time to buy).
After a few years of rather successful ETF investing, I started buying individual stocks in late 2016. I treaded water for most of the past four years, but finally started making more substantive gains once Robinhood started doing dividend reinvestment... up until a recent stupid mistake that I made that is, which wiped out all four years of my gains in that account 🙄 
But I'm not panicked, and I learned from my mistake. I'm confident that I'll get back on the right path again. Thankfully, the losses were only in my smallest account, and not the other four accounts with much larger balances.",,
