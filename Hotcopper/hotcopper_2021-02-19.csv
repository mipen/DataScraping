6.670692e+17,Hot News,News: TIMELINE-Events leading to Facebook’s dramatic unfriending of Australian news outlets,"(A TIMELINE is a sidebar that lists in chronological order events related to a major news story.) SYDNEY, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed on Friday to press ahead with laws to force Facebook Inc FB.O to pay news outlets for content, saying he had received support from world leaders after the social media giant blacked out all media. Heres a timeline of how the events unfolded in recent years. July 2017 - Australias competition regulator recommended a voluntary code in its Digital Platforms Inquiry to address bargaining power imbalances between major digital platforms - Google and Facebook - and media businesses. Dec 2017 - The watchdog -- Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) -- said it would investigate whether U.S. online giants Facebook and Alphabet Incs GOOGL.O Google have disrupted the news media market to the detriment of publishers and consumers. July 2019 - Australia said it would establish the worlds first dedicated office to police Facebook and Google as part of reforms designed to rein in the U.S. technology giants. Dec 2019 - The Government directed the ACCC to work with both the news and digital platform businesses to develop a voluntary code. April 2020 - the government directed the ACCC to draft a mandatory code after the regulator advised that the businesses were unlikely to reach voluntary agreement and COVID-19 exacerbated the pressures faced by Australian media sector July 2020 - The ACCC released draft legislation for the media bargaining code. July 2020 - Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says the country would force Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google to pay Australian media outlets for news content. Aug 2020 - Google criticised proposed Australian antitrust laws saying its free search service would be at risk and users personal data could be shared if it is made to pay news organisations for their content. Sept 2020 - Facebook said it would stop Australians sharing news content on its platforms if a proposal to make it pay local media outlets for their content becomes law. Sept 2020 - The ACCC says Facebook will be weakened if it stops Australians from sharing news so the company can avoid paying for content under proposed laws. Dec 2020 - The News Media Bargaining Bill 2020 was introduced to Parliament with the intent to force major digital platforms – Google and Facebook – to pay Australian media companies for use of news content. Feb 2021 - Google strikes deals with media companies including NewsCorp to pay for journalism. Feb 2021 - The news media bargaining code, which has bipartisan support, clears house of representatives. Feb 2021 - Facebook blocks news feeds in Australia in a surprise escalation of the dispute with the government, wiping out pages from Australian state governments and charities as well as from domestic and international news organisations.",51165856

6.6706494e+17,1ronnie,Its Over,"https://hotcopper.com.au/threads/its-over.4002109/page-7564?post_id=51137815#.YC9AiNgzapoLast night I posted the above re: emergence of a new mutated virus strain in the US. This one may cause a resurgence in US cases - a 4th wave - which is not yet imputed by the markets. One that may well lead to wide lockdowns in the US. I certainly hope that is not the case, but in these times, we should expect Anything and Everything and stay Ahead of the Curve as always.If this were to happen, it may well be the catalyst for the most anticipated US market correction (we had to have) and bring the last and final downdraft to Gold and Silver.....then we could hear more from the Fed and perhaps we get YCC (yield control curve) and then PM could surge thereafter. As I said, the next wave for PM is when we next get market pessimism and I cant see anything on the horizon except this (virus).No, I have not bought any gold or silver stocks just yet. Not when they are more likely to fall in tandem as markets correct.The longer the world continue to want to live with the virus by living life business as usual, the more protracted the pandemic will be and the greater the chance the virus will mutate before they get snuffed out. What is dearly missing- a unified Global approach towards pandemic management and eradication ! The Biden administration is not bold enough.....but we have to start somewhere. This complete reliance on vaccine per se isnt enough and being too presumptuous.Eric Hickman: 4th-Wave Of COVID-19 Will Push Rates To ZeroBy Lance Roberts of Real Investment AdviceThursday, February 18, 2021 10:24 AM ESTEric Hickman discusses why we should beware of the 4th-Wave of Covid-19.I know everyone is tired of hearing about the virus. Some think it is overblown by the media, many want to focus on the positives, and others have had their lives upended and want to forget.There are reasons for optimism. It is a new year with longer days and warmer temperatures. People continue to get inoculated with increasing speed. The approval of new vaccines continues as new cases, deaths, and hospitalizations from the third wave fall (see below). The 1918 Spanish Flu had three waves over about a year; the COVID-19 pandemic has had three over a year as well.Indeed, this is about over, right?Tuned Out?It isn’t over, and financial markets don’t accept that yet. I realize suggesting anything negative about the virus is misanthropic, but the truth matters and the optics are misleading.New cases decrease in the third wave because we are past the holidays, not because of vaccinations. It is a common misconception the decrease we’ve seen in the virus is due to vaccinations. The two aren’t related, at least yet.The decline in cases is likely a natural drop after record travel followed by indoor holiday gatherings triggered a surge in infections. – Dr. Sarita Shah, associate professor at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health.We’ve seen these rises and falls in the COVID case counts now a few times, and they seem to really track along holidays or people’s movements, Shah said.To EarlyCOVID-19 symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear after exposure, and cases peaked precisely two weeks after the Christmas holidays. – Brittany Baker, undergraduate program coordinator and clinical assistant professor at North Carolina Central University.Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said the falling case numbers couldn’t get attributed to the COVID-19 vaccine. Not even a tenth of the population has gotten vaccinated, according to the CDC.We’re vaccinating our most vulnerable populations right now, but once we start to move into the broad population, the population that’s driving the numbers. That’s when we’ll start to see an impact on the overall numbers, Shah said.She said Americans might start to see the vaccine’s influence on case numbers as early as the summer, but it will be more evident in the fall.U.S.A Today, 02/06/2021, Coronavirus cases are falling in the U.S., but experts say it’s not from the COVID-19 vaccine yet.New Sars-CoV-2 variantsAs with all replicating biological entities, viruses change over time with random mutations to their genetic code (genome) when reproducing. Most mutations do not affect or are detrimental. Still, every once in a while, a random change (or series of changes) will alter a trait that increases its biological fitness – its competitive advantage in its environment. Beneficial mutations get carried forward to new generations, which crowd out the inferior older genome. Such is natural selection.The process happens at a glacial pace in the life-forms we are most familiar with (say mammals) because reproduction takes years. Viruses replicate in a matter of hours to days, and more specifically, single-strand RNA viruses (of which the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is one) replicate faster than other viruses.Viruses that encode their genome in RNA, such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV and influenza, tend to pick up mutations quickly as they get copied inside their hosts, because enzymes that copy RNA are prone to making errors.Nature.com, 09/08/2020, The coronavirus is mutating – does it matter?The concerning new Sars-CoV-2 variants emerging from the U.K., South Africa, and Brazil have yet to become dominant in the U.S. On February 7, a study reported that the more transmissible U.K. variant is now spreading rapidly in the U.S. It could become the dominant strain by late March. Italy’s health ministry said on February 12 that the U.K. variant makes up 17.8% of cases and will likely become prevalent in the coming months. The vaccine-weakening South African and Brazilian variants got detected in the U.S. in January. There are now several cases dotted around the U.S. They will presumably gain traction as they did in their original countries. This process takes months.New VariantsThe variants detected recently in the U.K. and South Africa have several novel changes in their spike-protein genes.Scientists think one mutation these variants share could help the virus attach to and enter cells. The recently detected variant from Brazil shares a key spike-protein mutation with the one from South Africa.What we’re seeing is exactly what we expect to see. The surface proteins of the virus are under tremendous pressure to change. – Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis.All the virus really cares about is multiplying. If it can get into the cells of the [host] and avoid the immune system of that host, it will multiply. Whether it causes the disease is a different question.Some scientists worry that South Africa’s variant could be better at evading antibodies produced in response to natural infection and vaccination. Preliminary estimates suggest the variant from the U.K. is 50%–70% more transmissible than earlier versions of the virus. And U.K. scientists said recently that early data suggested it could also be deadlier.The variants found in the U.K. and South Africa have become the dominant types in countries where they were first detected.Chart Source: Wall Street JournalParallel EvolutionThe variant from the U.K. has spread widely abroad. As of late January, it had been reported in 70 countries and territories. The variant from South Africa has been reported in more than 30, while the U.K. variant was detected in more than two dozen U.S. states through late January. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projected it could become the dominant domestic strain by mid- to late March unless steps are taken to slow it. Variants first found in South Africa and Brazil have also been detected in the U.S.WSJ, 01/30/2021, How Coronavirus Mutations Are Taking OverRestricting travel between continents may prevent these variants from getting around, but there is another wrinkle to this. In biology, convergent or parallel evolution is a common yet counter-intuitive phenomenon. Independent lineages of a biological entity can arrive at similar evolutionary fitness solutions without any interaction between them. The similarity between the sugar glider (marsupial from Australia) and the flying squirrel (mammal from North America) is an example of this (image below).Image Source: Getty/Encyclopedia Brittanica/UIGMutantsThe same phenomenon is happening with Sars-CoV-2 mutations. Critical mutations from the U.K. variant (N501Y) and the one shared by the South African and Brazilian variants (E484K) emerged independently in a now-deceased Boston COVID-19 patient with prolonged continuous infection. There are quotes from a National Public Radio story below. But for those interested, it is an interesting read (or listen) found at the link below:Li and his colleagues published their findings in The New England Journal of Medicine in early November 2020 with little fanfare. Then about a month later, the pandemic took a surprising turn – and this peculiar case in Boston took on a new importance.Scientists in the U.K. and South Africa announced they had detected new variants of the coronavirus. These variants were causing huge surges of COVID-19 in these countries.When researchers looked at the genes of these variants, guess what they found? A cluster of mutations that looked remarkably similar to the mutations found in the virus from the Boston patient. The sets of mutations weren’t exactly identical, but they shared important characteristics. They both had about 20 mutations, and they shared several key ones, including a mutation (N501Y) known to help the virus bind more tightly to human cells and another mutation (E484K) known to help the virus evade antibody detection.National Public Radio, 2/5/2021, Extraordinary Patient Offers Surprising Clues to Origins of Coronavirus VariantsThe virus may optimize itself to known mutations without spreading geographically, weakening the power of travel restrictions.New Variants Will EmergeThe virus is just a little over one-year-old on its new metaphorical planet of humans and is still trying to find an evolutionary best fit. A safe assumption is that more variants will emerge.Look, there is going to be a whole cascade of these new variants. The virus moved between species. It migrated from the back end of a pangolin and to humans. And it’s got to adapt to humans. What we see now is it is getting better and better and more efficient at living in humans. And that we can see a set of other mutations coming down the line. So, I think we mustn’t say ‘ahh, well we now know what the mutations are going to look like.’ We don’t. There’s gonna be a set of other ones.U.K. Channel 4 news, 01/24/2021, Interview with Prominent Virologist Sir John BellEven though vaccination plans for developed-world adults are firming up, the developing world and children are less clear. As long as the virus circulates in humans anywhere, it will find new optimizations that will likely require vaccine alterations.The more widespread infections remain globally, the more mutations will occur. A lingering pool of cases in poorer countries risks giving birth to resistant strains that force richer economies to lock down and start vaccinating all over again.Financial Times, 02/05/2021, The global race between vaccines and mutationsTaken together, it is probable that the world will have at least one more severe wave of infections this spring and summer – a fourth wave – before the inoculated and previously infected can crowd out those with no protection. Re-vaccination (booster shots) for new variants add to this timeline.Rates Will Fall DramaticallySuch isn’t doomsday, but at a minimum, it elongates the time until battered industries (hospitality, entertainment) will have a chance to recover. So far, markets continue to believe the pandemic is a net benefit to bigger businesses globally (all-time highs in public companies, see below).The explanation for this is that it is only the small, non-public companies that are struggling.That is far-fetched.The pandemic will cost the world’s public companies in aggregate at some point. I wrote nine months ago that COVID-19 Defies Hyperbole. Even though risk-on markets had gone up when I suggested they would go down, I stand by my prediction. Apt fiscal and monetary injections forestalled a deeper contraction. Still, it is a delusion to think we will get out of this for free – especially in a world economy that was overdue for a retraction anyways.Even without a fourth COVID-19 wave, the negative impact on jobs, rents, consumer demand, tax revenue, and entire economy segments (hospitality, entertainment) has yet to be considered seriously. As they become so, risk-on markets (stocks, commodities, crypto-currencies, houses, and non-G-7 currencies) will drop, and long-term U.S. Treasury yields will fall dramatically.

6.6706392e+17,1ronnie,Its Over,"..I have been Ahead of the Curve cautioning you earlier re: headwinds for gold stocks. I was rather surprised ASX200 having touched 6600 on Feb1 did a spectacular U-turn to make new highs above 6900. Is the market having a change of heart, capitulating and being anticipatory of weakness in the US markets? Winning Is Not Losing, I could not have said it more often.Market Bubble Looks Near To BurstingFeb. 18, 2021 11:02 AM ETDDM, DIA, DOG...62 Comments20 LikesSummaryLiquidity is fueling asset bubbles in the US tech sector and elsewhere.Margin debt is also spiking, and historically has presaged sharp declines.Cyclical rotation, change in market sentiment, or rising interest rates could also lead to a bursting bubble.An abundance of liquidity, a strong appetite for speculative risk, and a fear of missing out has combined to fuel asset bubbles in the US tech sector, cryptocurrencies, and many speculative startups in favored market segments. Margin debt is also spiking, and is contributing to the speculative frenzy. Valuations are at dot com boom levels in some tech names, while the broader markets are trading at the high-end of their historical range. All of these signs point to a coming market correction or bursting of the tech bubble.Liquidity Fueling BubblesOne of the lesser considered consequences of the year-long pandemic has been the sudden increase in savings rates. People staying at home means all that money that wouldve been spent on vacations, business travel, transportation, restaurants, bars, theater, sporting events and other activities have been saved, leading to increased savings rates and more cash for investments. The US savings rate had long been in the mid- to upper-single digits, but last year, it spiked to nearly 33.7% in April- the highest monthly rate on record since 1959- and remained at least double previous levels throughout the year and into 2021.US Savings RateSource: Tradingeconomics.comOf course, another source of money has been coming from both monetary and fiscal policy stimulus over the last year or so, which is reflected in the massive increase in the M2 money supply:Source: longtermtrends.netAs you can see at the end of the chart, M2 money supply has increased 25% over the past year, 250% more than at any other point in the last 30 years. Many economists believe growth in M2 money supply is linked to inflation, although this 30-year chart showing both inflation and M2 money supply doesnt indicate a strong correlation. The massive growth in M2 over the past year may well put that to the test, however.Another contributing factor to the run-up in stock valuations is the substantial increase in margin debt, which also has historically been the canary in the coal mine for stock market corrections.Source: advisorperspectives.comThis chart shows the real growth in both the S&P 500 in blue and real margin debt in red, going back to 1997. As you can see from the chart, spikes in margin debt presaged the market crashes in 2000 and again in 2008. What we see once again in 2020 is a spike in margin debt. Total margin debt stood at nearly $800 billion as of the end of December, 2020. In previous market crashes, following the spike in margin debt, margin calls added to the selling as investors were forced to sell their holdings to meet the margin call.Of course, all this money and margin debt went somewhere. Bond markets have been in the doldrums for years, bank and money market interest rates remained basically zero, and so with not much competition, equity markets became the recipient of much of those funds. And with so many of the more value-oriented stocks facing the brunt of the pandemic, growth stocks became the favored investment. The pandemic only served to hasten the secular changes that had already been underway for some time, and stocks that supported the move toward the online and digital space became the big winners. Online retailers, digital payments, internet communications became the big winners. The popularity of ESG investing also fueled tremendous growth in everything to do with green energy, electric vehicles, and the like.That led to some enormous valuations for favored stocks, comparable and exceeding those of the dot com boom just before the crash.Chart produced by author. Data source: BloombergThe chart above compares forward P/E valuations in some of the high-flying tech stocks on March 10, 2000 - just before the dot com bubble burst - with those of todays high-flying tech stocks as of January 26th, 2021.The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 also rose to levels not seen since the aftermath of dot com bubble at the turn of the century:Source: FactSetEven the broader S&P 500 is trading at the high-end of its range in a few metrics:Source: Multpl.comSource: Multpl.comSource: Multpl.comEach of the above S&P 500 valuation metrics, price/sales, the Shiller CAPE or cyclically adjusted P/E ratio, and the trailing 12-month P/E ratio suggest the S&P 500 is at the high-end of its historical range - levels that historically resulted in a correction, perhaps even a substantial one.The chart below shows the 10-year Cyclically Adjusted Price/Earnings (CAPE) ratio for the S&P 500 along with regression trendlines:Source: advisorperspectives.comAs you can see, the S&P 500 P/E is currently trading around 155% above the real, inflation-adjusted regression trendline, and 68% above the CAPE trendline, both indicating a bubble in the stock market. As you can see, when the S&P Composite approached these levels in the past, a correction ensued - and sometimes a substantial one bringing valuations back below the trendline.What Could Trigger the BurstThe difficulty with bubble valuations is that sometimes they can persist for a period of time, and its difficult to anticipate what may trigger the bursting of the bubble.The VIX, a measure of implied volatility in S&P 500 futures markets, just closed below 20 late last week, suggesting investors are complacent with current known risk factors. On the other hand, investors also piled $850 million into the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF (NYSEARCA:UVXY), which now has a record number of shares, suggesting investors are either hedging their equity positions against future volatility, and/or betting on increased volatility in the not too distant future. The VIX has risen back above 21 most recently.Investors also seemed mildly concerned with the recent rise in the 10-year Treasury yield to 1.3%, a level it hadnt reached since before the pandemic. Rising Treasury yields are seen as a sign of investor confidence - selling bonds to move into presumably riskier investments - but rising yields also mean rising interest rates on debt, from mortgages and credit cards to corporate debt. Higher interest rates, in turn, can dampen earnings outlooks. At this point, however, interest rate movements of this magnitude wouldnt seem to be enough to move the needle much in terms of overall market sentiment. Should the massive increase in the M2 money supply lead to a more substantial increase in inflation, and corresponding rising interest rates, that could have a larger impact and potentially lead to the bubble bursting. The Producer Price Index reading this week showed an increase of 1.3%, its largest increase since December 2009, suggesting inflation is starting to increase at the producer level.What also might burst the bubble areas of the market may be a view that better opportunities lie elsewhere, causing a sell-off in frothier sectors of the market. The perception that cyclical, more value-oriented stocks, which havent participated in the market gains nearly as much as growth stocks in recent years, and especially this last year, may begin to look more attractive as the pandemic eases and those businesses get back to normal. Many analysts expect earnings in cyclical stocks to pick up this year, and with more attractive valuations, may present better opportunities going forward. Some growth stocks may be hurt by an economy and behavior moving back toward pre-pandemic norms. Commodities are another area some analysts are suggesting is in the early innings of a bull market that could last for some time, as both supply and demand factors could play a role in rising commodity prices for some time to come. Similarly, some analysts expect emerging markets, which have underperformed US stock markets in recent years, may rebound as well.In any case, if investors, particularly institutional investors, begin moving out of some of the frothier growth stocks into other investments, that could trigger a sell-off in growth stocks and potentially trigger margin calls as well.The question of it being an orderly sell-off remains an open one. Investors who remember the bursting of the tech bubble 21 years ago may not wait around to see if the sell-off is orderly or not. Fear of missing out could turn to a fear of steep losses in a hurry. That could lead to another mass exit as a herd mentality takes hold, as it did following previous market bubbles.Stay tuned.",51162491

Technically the top rail should be strong support but with the H&S top just above it there could be some strong downward pressure. How many remember the 2016 H&S top that came out of nowhere to reverse that impulse move?(Click on image to enlarge)The best outcome for the HUI would be if the August expanding falling wedge finds support on top of the 2016 triangle.(Click on image to enlarge)The top rail of the 2016 triangle reversal pattern comes into full view on this long-term monthly chart for the HUI which technically should hold support. What you don’t want to see is important trendlines fail as that is a sign of weakness. So far nothing is broken.(Click on image to enlarge)This last long-term chart for the HUI is its history chart which shows its secular bull market and all the consolidation and reversal patterns it has formed since 1996. To say the 250 area is an important area of support is an understatement. For those that are so inclined to do some bottom fishing this would be a pretty low-risk environment using the top rail of the 2016 triangle as your line in the sand, above is bullish, and below is bearish. As I already have my profits locked in I’m content to watch the price action for a while and see what develops. When in doubt be more cautious.(Click on image to enlarge)",51153991

6.670467e+17,Hot News,News: Canada vows to be next country to go after Facebook to pay for news,"Canada vowed on Thursday to make Facebook Inc FB.O pay for news content, seeking allies in the media battle with tech giants and pledging not to back down if the social media platform shuts off the countrys news as it did in Australia. Facebook blocked all Australian news content on its service over proposed legislation requiring it and Alphabet Incs Google GOOGL.O to pay fees to Australian publishers for news links. Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, in charge of crafting similar legislation to be unveiled in coming months, condemned Facebooks action and said it would not deter Ottawa. Canada is at the forefront of this battle ... we are really among the first group of countries around the world that are doing this, he told reporters. Last year, Canadian media organizations warned of a potential market failure without government action. They said the Australian approach would permit publishers to recover C$620 million a year. Without action, they warned, Canada would lose 700 print journalism jobs out of 3,100 total. Guilbeault said Canada could adopt the Australian model, which requires Facebook and Google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive activity on their services, or agree on a price through binding arbitration. Another option is to follow the example of France, which requires large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content. We are working to see which model would be the most appropriate, he said, adding he spoke last week to his French, Australian, German and Finnish counterparts about working together on ensuring fair compensation for web content. I suspect that soon we will have five, 10, 15 countries adopting similar rules ... is Facebook going to cut ties with Germany, with France? he asked, saying that at some point Facebooks approach would become totally unsustainable. University of Toronto professor Megan Boler, who specializes in social media, said the Facebook action marked a turning point which would require a common international approach. We could actually see a coalition, a united front against this monopoly, which could be very powerful, she said in a phone interview. This week, Facebook said news makes up less than 4% of content people see on the platform but contended that it helped Australian publishers generate about AU $407 million last year. Google has signed 500 deals worth around $1 billion over three years with publishers around the world for its new News Showcase service and is in talks with Canadian companies. Guilbeault said Google would still be subject to the new Canadian new law, since Ottawa wanted an approach that was fair, transparent and predictable. Whats to say that Google - tomorrow, six months, a year from now - doesnt change its mind and says its doesnt want to do that any more? he said. Lauren Skelly, a spokeswoman for Google in Canada, declined to comment on Guilbeaults remarks, saying the company did not know details of the legislation. Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in Internet and e-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said Canada should aspire to Googles approach, where companies put money into content that provided added value. If we follow the Australian model ... well find ourself in much the same spot, he said by phone. Everybody loses. The media organizations lose ... Facebook loses. Kevin Chan, head of public policy for Facebook in Canada, said there were other options to support news in Canada that will more fairly benefit publishers of all sizes.",51148639

I have been cautioning that the rise of the DXY would be a headwind for all commodities especially PM.Gold’s Downtrend: Is This Just The Beginning?By Przemyslaw Radomski of Sunshine ProfitsThursday, February 18, 2021 11:23 AM ESTWith the yellow metal just posting its lowest close since June and a bearish pattern forming, how vulnerable is gold to a further decline?Gold and mining stocks just broke to new yearly lows – as I warned you in my previous analyses. And that’s only the beginning.Let’s jump right into the charts, starting with gold.Figure 1 - COMEX Gold FuturesIn early February, gold broke below the rising red support line and it then verified it by rallying back to it and then declining once again. It topped almost exactly right at its triangle-vertex-based reversal, which was yet another time when this technique proved to be very useful.Gold has just closed not only at new yearly lows, but also below the late-November lows (in terms of the closing prices, there was no breakdown in intraday terms). This means that yesterday’s (Feb. 17) closing price was the lowest daily close since late June 2020. At the moment of writing these words, gold is also trading below the April 2020 intraday high.Gold was likely to slide based on myriads of technical and cyclical factors, while the fundamental factors remain very positive – especially considering that we are about to enter the Kondratiev winter, or we are already there. As a reminder, Kondratiev cycles are one of the longest cycles and the stages of the cycle take names after seasons. Winter tends to start with a stock market top that is caused by excessive credit. In this stage gold is likely to perform exceptionally well… But not right at its start. Even the aftermath of the 1929 top (Winter started then as well), gold stocks declined for about 3 months before soaring. In the first part of the cycle, cash is likely to be king. And it seems that the performance of the USD Index is already telling investors to buckle up.And speaking of stocks, what about mining stocks? As you might already well know, just as with gold, the miners moved below the November lows in terms of both the intraday prices and daily closing prices. What does that mean? If you’d like to explore mining stocks in detail and are curious to know more about their prices and possible exit levels, then our full version of the analyses contains exactly what you need to know.Getting back to gold…Figure 2If the fact that gold invalidated its breakout above its 2011 high, despite the ridiculously positive fundamental situation, doesn’t convince you that gold does not really want to move higher before declining profoundly first, then the above chart might.As I wrote above, gold is currently more or less when it was trading at the April 2020 top. Where was the USD Index trading back then? It was moving back and forth around the 100 level.100!The USD Index closed a little below 91, and gold is at the same price level! That’s a massive 9 index-point decline in the USDX that gold shrugged off just like that.There’s no way that gold could ignore this kind of movement and be strong at the same time. No. It’s been very weak in the previous months, which is a strong sign (not a fundamental one, but a critical one nonetheless) that gold is going to move much lower once the USD Index finally rallies back up.Right now, waiting for gold to rally is like waiting for the light to turn green, arguing that eventually it has to turn green, while not realizing that the light is broken (gold just didn’t rally despite the huge decline in the USDX). Yes, someone will fix it and eventually it will turn green, but it doesn’t mean that it makes much sense to wait for that to happen, instead of looking around and crossing the street if it’s safe to do so.Yes, gold is likely to rally to new highs in the coming years. And silver is likely to skyrocket. But in light of just two of the above-mentioned factors (gold’s extreme underperformance relative to the USD Index and the invalidation of a critical breakdown) doesn’t it make sense not to purchase gold right now (except for the insurance capital that is) in order to buy it after several weeks / few months when it’s likely to be trading at much lower levels?We live in very specific times. Getting a like on a post or picture becomes a necessary daily activity and means of self-validation. Not liking something that others posted or that is massively liked may be frowned upon or even viewed as being disrespectful. Plus, it seems that no matter what you do, everyone gets offended very easily. When did honesty, independence and common-sense stop being virtues?When it comes to gold investment analysis, it’s surprisingly similar. You either like gold and think that it’s going higher right away or you’re one of them. Them can be anyone who tries to manipulate gold or silver prices, banksters, or some kind of unknown enemy. Analysts goal is often no longer to be as objective as possible and to provide as good and as unbiased an analysis as possible, but to simply be cheering for gold and provide as many bullish signals as possible regardless of what one really thinks about them. The above may seem pleasant to readers, but it’s not really in their best interest. In order to make the most of any upswing, it’s best to enter the market as low as possible and to exit relatively close to the top. What happens before a price is as low as possible? It declines. Why would something like that (along with those describing it) be hated by gold investors? It makes no sense, but yet, it’s often the case.Top of FormBottom of FormThe discussion – above and below – can be viewed as something positive or negative for any investor, but while reading it, please keep in mind that our goal is the same as yours – we want to help investors make the most of their precious metals investments. Call us old-fashioned, but regardless of how unpleasant it may seem, we’ll continue to adhere to honesty, independence and common-sense in all our analysesOk, but why on Earth would the USD Index rally back up? The Fed is printing so much dollars – why would they be worth more?!Because the currencies are valued with relation to each other and whether or not the USD Index moves higher or lower doesn’t depend only on what the Fed is doing.Figure 3What other monetary authorities do matters as well and right now the ECB is outprinting the Fed (that’s what the decline in the green line above means), which means that the euro is likely to fall more than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the EUR/USD currency exchange rate would be likely to decline and since this exchange rate is the biggest (over 50%) component of the USD Index, it makes perfect sense – from the fundamental point of view – to expect the USD Index to move higher.Can gold rally despite higher USD Index values? Absolutely. However, it would first have to start to behave normally relative to the USD Index, and before that happens it would have to stop being extremely weak relative to it. And the fact that gold is at the same price level despite a 9-index-point decline in the USDX is extreme weakness.To make the technical discussion easier, I’m attaching the previous chart once again.Figure 4On Monday (Feb. 15), I wrote the following about the above chart:The size and shape of the 2017-2018 analogue continues to mirror the current price action. However, today, it’s taken 118 less days for the USD Index to move from peak to trough. Also, it took 82 days for the USDX to bottom in 2017-2018 (the number of days between the initial bottom and the final bottom) and the number amounts to 21.19% of the overall duration. If we apply a similar timeframe to today’s move, it implies that a final bottom may have formed on Feb. 12. As a result, the USDX’s long-term upswing could begin as soon as this week. Also noteworthy, as the USDX approached its final bottom in 2017-2018, gold traded sideways. Today, however, gold is already in a downtrend. From a medium-term perspective, the yellow metal’s behavior is actually more bearish than it was in 2017-2018. Also supporting the historical analogue, the USD Index’s current breakout above its 50-day moving average is exactly what added gasoline to the USDX’s 2018 fire. Case in point? After the 2018 breakout, the USDX surged back to its previous high. Today, that level is roughly 94.5.Based on this week’s rally it seems that the final bottom formed on Tuesday (Feb. 16) – just 2 trading days away from the analogy-based target, and in perfect tune with what I wrote back then. The breakout above both: the declining blue line, and the 50-day moving average was verified, and the short-term outlook here is clearly bullish.But isn’t the current situation similar to what happened in mid-2020? The correction that was followed by another decline?In a way, it is. In both cases, the USD Index moved higher after a big decline, but that’s about it as far as important similarities are concerned.What is different is the entire context. Even a single look at the above chart provides an instant answer. The mid-2020 correction was like the mid-2017 correction, and what we see right now is the post-bottom breakout, just as we saw in the first half of 2018.There are multiple details on the above chart that confirm it, including the sizes of the medium-term declines, the position of the price relative to the declining support/resistance lines, as well as relative to the 50-day moving average, and even the green arrows in the RSI indicator show how similar the preceding action was in case of this indicator. The vertical dashed line shows where we are right now in case of the analogy.Also, the fact that the general stock market has not yet declined in any substantial way only makes the short-term outlook worse (particularly for silver and miners). When stocks do slide, they would be likely to impact the prices of miners and silver particularly strongly.And please remember, we’re looking for the bottom in the precious metals sector not because we’re the enemy of gold or the precious metals investor . On the contrary, we’re that true friend that tells you if something’s not right, even if it may be unpleasant to hear. We want to buy more and at better prices close to the bottom, and we’ll continue to strive to assist you with that as well.",51148162

But for retailers, a few or tens of thousands of losses is their mortgage money or worse food on the table.Many retail players lost money no thanks to this reddit rebellion.Meet The Hedge Fund That Made A Killing On The Reddit-Fueled Short SqueezeZero HedgeWEDNESDAY, FEB 03, 2021 - 14:46So much for sticking it to the suits.The unfortunate reality of Wall Street is that, sooner or later, we knew that hedge fund players would emerge who capitalized on the Reddit-fueled squeezes of the last two weeks.One such fund was Jason Mudrick’s hedge fund. Mudrick Capital Management made almost $200 million, fueled by stakes in names that squeezed higher during the GameStop frenzy, according to Bloomberg. His fund made 9.8% in January, one of the best months since the funds inception. Most of its gains came from debt and equity options in AMC and volatility bets in GameStop.The fund has $3.1 billion under management and booked most of its gains last week. It also sold about $50 million worth of out of the money call options on AMC, the report says. Back in September, AMC had signed a commitment letter with Mudrick Capital that called for the hedge fund to buy $100 million of new secured bonds that pay 15% cash or 17% deferred interest, the report notes.Mudrick bought AMCs second-lien bonds for 7 to 20 cents on the dollar, before they rose to about 70 cents on the dollar last week. His firm specializes in distressed debt investments and is in the process of expanding further into Europe. It recently bought a credit hedge fund run by CVC Credit Partners.As we have already noted, Silver Lake also saw about $113 million in gains from converting AMC debt it was holding to stock, before selling the stock into the rally.Many other funds, including several of the Tiger Cubs werent so lucky, Bloomberg noted. Numerous firms with ties to Julian Robertsons Tiger Management racked up losses during the run up:Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital Management lost 13% last monthSteve Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital dropped 6.4%.Coatue Management ended the month little changedChase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management eked out a 1% gainRob Citrone’s Discovery Capital Management, a macro-focused fund, jumped 6.5% for the monthRicky Sandler’s $7.8 billion Eminence Capital fell 10.5% last month in his hedge fundWhale Rock Capital Management sunk almost 11% in its technology, media and telecommunications-focused fundMarshall Wace’s $4.4 billion long-short MW Global Opportunities Fund slumped an estimated 7% in January, its worst-ever monthly declineAs a reminder, while hedge funds were cashing out - we wrote yesterday that Reddit user and de facto WallStreetBets leader Deepfuckingvalue, after initially making a killing on GameStops move to $350, had lost $19 million over the course of just two days.DFV, also known as Keith Gill, became the Pied Piper of GameStop, sharing screenshots of his portfolio which inspired thousands of amateur retail investors to follow him into the ailing retailer too, while orchestrating the biggest short squeeze ever.Sadly for Gill, after his account peaked in the middle of last week, its all been downhill, and the money that took Gill over a year to accumulate he lost more than half in just two days: on Feb 1, DFV was down $5.2 million to $35.8 million including the cash, or $22 million in GME securities...... followed by a record drawdown yesterday, when he lost $13.6 million bringing the value of his GME securities to just $8.4 million.While for a hedge fund this sum is pocket change, for a trader who started off with $50,000 and worked diligently for nearly two years to build up a loyal following, the amount means months of hard work flushed down the drain.

GameStop Investors Who Bet Big – and Lost Big. Excerpt:Salvador Vergara was so enthusiastic about GameStop in late January that he took out a $20,000 personal loan and used it to purchase shares. Then the buzzy stock plunged nearly 80%.GameStops volatile ride is hitting the portfolios of individual investors like Mr. Vergara who purchased the stock in a social-media-fueled frenzy. These casual traders say GameStop was their YOLO, or you only live once, trade. They bought around its late January peak, betting it would continue its astronomical climb. While some cashed out before it crashed, others who hung onto their shares are in the red.Mr. Vergara, a 25-year-old security guard in Virginia, started investing four years ago after deciding he wanted to retire young. To save money, he drives a 1998 Honda Civic, eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad. He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds, which are now valued at about $50,000. Then Mr. Vergara, a longtime reader of the WallStreetBets page on Reddit, saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stocks colossal rise.He didnt want to touch his index-fund investments, so instead he got a personal loan with an 11.19% interest rate from a credit union and used it to fund most of his GameStop purchase. He bought shares at $234 each.GameStop shares started the year around $19, zoomed to nearly $350 (and almost hit $500 in intraday trading) in late January, and then began to spiral back to earth. The shares closed Friday at $52.40, down 85% from the peak close.I thought it could go up to $1,000. I really believed in that hype, which was an awful thing to do, Mr. Vergara said.He plans to hold on to the shares because he believes in the companys turnaround, he said, and use his paycheck to cover the monthly payments on the personal loan. Once the pandemic is over, he hopes to move back to his native Philippines, live off savings and start a charity. The GameStop loss set those plans back about six months, he said.mce-anchor2) This research perfectly captures what happened on Reddits WallStreetBets message board: The courage to buy GameStop was lauded – and led to a debacle... When Do People Take Huge Risks? Excerpt:If were so loss averse, why do we take such big swings in our lives?Their theory: courage. The ability to take purposeful action in the face of fear is widely prized across cultures; one study found that courage was among just six values shared by nearly every philosophical and religious tradition.Because much of the research on risk and loss aversion focuses on low-stakes financial gambles, [Derek] Rucker and [David] Gal suspected different patterns might emerge if they studied important life decisions, where courage is most likely to emerge.Indeed, across several experiments, thats precisely what Rucker and Gal found. When facing a risky choice with meaningful consequences for their lives, people have the opportunity to display courage. And because people prize being courageous, in contrast to prior research findings, they may be more likely to opt for the high-risk, high-reward path.This suggests that, in contrast to some of the findings in controlled laboratory gambles, people might have a radically different response to risk in some situations, Rucker says. When people see an opportunity to be courageous, and want to see themselves as courageous, that may actually lead to a preference for the riskier option.The article concludes:The Gifts and Perils of CourageTo these researchers, this work highlights an important and understudied aspect of decision-making: values like courage can override other psychological impulses, especially when the real-world stakes are high.It also suggests that we need to evaluate how our desire for courage might push us toward decisions that arent wise in the end. You could imagine where you might get into trouble, Rucker says. Theres a danger of saying I want to feel courageous when youre going down a path that is not a good decision.Sometimes you do need to be bold and courageous. But other times you might want to ask yourself, Wait, is being bold the right decision here, or do I need to take a step back and think through an appropriate, measured action?",51141509
