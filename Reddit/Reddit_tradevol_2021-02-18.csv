Friday) and I'm all in /ES to catch the euphoria ripSPX close between 3870-3920 on Friday and I'll just spend the rest of my life BTFD bc nothing matters but the FedSPX close below 3870 on Friday and I'm assuming we're smashing down to at least 3700Anyway here's a good Twitter thread (and account to follow)

As counterintuitive as it sounds it will do the opposite. It is important to distinguish between the VIX cash or index and the VROs VIX options and VX VIX futures. I think you would be better off  reading the spec sheets provided by the CBOE, but long story short VIX futures capture 60 to 70 % ( at optimal conditions)  of the variations in the index  and the options track the futures ( again read the spec sheet and look for the SOQ). The ETPs are usually a combination of different term VX futures ( that adds more roll yield considerations) and I would suggest reading the specific spec sheet for each ETP. As an example  the VXX is a combination of current and coming maturity futures. The weighting of each future in the ETP is variable and in function of each passing day to compensate for the roll yield. I hope this helps this isn't a straightforward trading endeavor but it'll be good for you.Feel free to drop by: https://www.reddit.com/r/VolTrading/"

6.63895349e+17,84149000.0,venturingout,Series of bad decisions. Holding 10k $UVXY average price $23,Reddit_tradevol_2021-02-18.csv,REDDIT,COM,"I would second the idea of selling covered calls. Some data to think about first:UVXY is an ETF following 1.5x leveraged SPVXSP, which in turn is a weighted index of 1st and 2nd month vix futuresThe SPVXSP index is meant to represent 1m constant maturity forward (CMF) of the vix index which is at 24.9 as of yesterday's close (1m fut * 1m weight + 2m fut * 2m weight)Looking at the timeseries of 1m CMF on vix over 13y (incl '08), we're at the ~75th percentile with min at 11.4 and max at 70.5 (max reached last year)Intraday max was probably higher, but for arguments sake let's assume that max on the indexUVXY closed at 10.66 yesterdayHence, even if we went to that max tomorrow, your upside is probably capped somewhere around there, i.e. 70.5 / 24.9 * 1.5 * 10.66 = 45.2. Meaning that if the vix futures trades where they have at their most distressed last year, UVXY would trade at 45, not 110 --> rolldown and leveraging magic...The reason we went from around this level to 110 in feb/mar-20 was two things, (1) because the 1m constant maturity forward was around 15 and went to 70.5, i.e. 70.5 / 15 * 1.5 * 11 = 77.5 and (2) the fact that the futures curve inverted (1m expiry futures more valuable than 2m --> roll up with leverage) So assuming that you're not of the view that we will have an even bigger market event in the coming months than last year, you're upside is probably capped at around 45 (+/- any curve inversion).My view is that something like UVXY should trade around 6-7$ by JuneSo in terms of what to do:You're in a tough spot, if the remaining value of the position is a lot of money for you (e.g. money you can't really afford to lose), it's probably best to just cut it and move on.If you can and want to spend a lot of time and energy to try and recover, I think covered calls are the thing to trade around this. For example:Selling 23 strike jun21 exp calls are trading at around $2.90 mid (iVol at 190%) and are around 50% delta, so if you sell those, you will mitigate around half the damage of any move lower and collect around 27% of your current exposure (2.9 / 10.66 = 27%) by june. You will also benefit from an iVol move lower which should happen if vix moves into a lower range. The issue here is that as and when the 1m CMF collapses back to a more 'normal' level like the 50th percentile,  ~19 and if the curve continues to be steep vix < 1m future < 2m future, you will be in pain and by the time june comes and you want to roll out your 23 strike call, you'll prob get a lot less for it. If at that point you're willing to take some extra risk, you can roll the strike down too, e.g. to 20 or 18 strike, you might be able to recoup more. Hence, an alternative:Selling 23 strike jan23 expiry calls around mid at 6.70 (ivol ~155%), delta of 76%. It's a touch better from a final recovery perspective and you need to worry less about rolling the call out. But be warned, you are likely going to lock in your loss, you will be married to the position and have limited upside. Wouldn't be my preference, but you get rid of more of the outright risk and reduce the roll risk. It's also pretty illiquid...Finally, if you have extra cash to put against this as collateral, you could consider selling double the notional on 23 strike jun21, i.e. 200 contracts. Gives much better economics (delta flat between your outright and the option and you collect 50% of you existion notional), but big big health warning, you can lose a lot more if you do that and probably need to buy more UVXY if the market pukes again. If you were in a fund or bank, might be a trade they would do, but not something for the faint hearted or the undercapitalised...In any case, for any of the covered call trades, make sure to work a limit order, market order will kill you there.Obviously all of this is not formal advice or anything, def need to do your homework on this before adding calls into the mix.Edit: thanks for the gold! Good luck!"

If you use something like Wilders ATR (https://www.quantshare.com/sa-527-using-average-true-range-to-measure-intraday-volatility) and then do the timeseries of intraday realised volatility of the max of the three component returns, your 30d realised is actually more like 22.5, bang on where vix is trading, rather than the 30d close-to-close realised vol of 10).So my guess is actually vol is not that 'expensive' here if you include intraday moves which you have no reason not to capture (if you own options, you can delta hedge and make money on higher realised vs implied vol and SPX futures are open almost all day).To answer the question though:There's 2 ways UVXY or similar can go lower: (1) the 1m CMF goes lower i.e. vix <20, vix futs <25 and (2) the vix vs 1m CMF realises the roll yield, i.e. vix stays consistently in a lower range than where 1m and 2m futures are trading over the next few months.In my view, unless intraday realised vol comes down too, we won't see vix leading the charge lower, hence my assumption is (conservatively) that vix stays in a 20-30 range for the next few months, but UVXY will move lower because of the roll yield realising, eg. assume that vix stays in the lower end of the range from today til end of jun with 1m CMF 6% higher on average and 1m < 2m, then you can back of the envelope, assume UVXY in jun = (1 - 0.06 * 1.5)^5.5 * 10.2 = 6.1.But tbh man, short UVXY outright in size here, balls of steel... I hope you have the $$ for the margin if we blow up. Also think about risk-reward, you're potentially making 30-40% in 6 months risking a pretty chunky loss. Could be more of course if we fully normalise, but who knows when that'll happen...Edit: maths on the UVXY roll yield calc - forgot the leverage"

We have all the data points that matter: the business cycle is getting better (look at PMI, commodity pricing, every leading indicator is en fuego, and comps actually only get easier) and we haven‚Äôt even gotten the new stimulus yet. On the rates side, the Fed is saying they want to create an asset bubble. They want inflation to be >2% and are keeping rates pinned at zero until we get there. Anything goes wrong they‚Äôll just print more.What are people so anxious about? I don‚Äôt really get it. DJT‚Äôs departure is a total cluster but it shouldn‚Äôt matter for corporate profits.Level of vol is really unprecedented for how strong fundamentals are. I just think everyone is anchoring to how bad the world was a year ago and we normalize in terms of VIX levels shortly after Trump moves to Boca and isn‚Äôt on the news anymore. Also check out Cuomo‚Äôs most recent presentation on opening NYC: now that we have a unified party in charge, Covid is going to become a more solvable problem. He wants the city open ASAP. And scaled vaccines not far away. Institutions will start shorting vol again and that could put pressure on realized. And when I say ‚Äúin size‚Äù I mean like a 7% position paired with a long equity portfolio that obviously will be positively correlated with short vol. I am prepared for these things to go up 3x.

I don‚Äôt short vol ever below 15 but >20 when world is clearly getting better... you only get a change to do this every 3-4 years. Edit: adding commentary on Cuomo reopening and VIX levels.

Fortunately have been sized in a way to ride out volatility but I mean I could not have gotten that initial move any more incorrect.MS vol strategists are arguing today retail is back in size on long vol trade and overwhelming institutional short vol capacity, making the market less stable. Maybe the case... who knows. I still think we trend lower on realized and implied given the macro environment. Expected value on the trade is high but you can‚Äôt size it too bug given convexity.Could I ask you to clarify how you calculate the roll yield? I‚Äôve been trying to research it and see so many different answers. Like the 6% you cited above, what‚Äôs the relationship there? Is that CMF vs spot VIX? Or is that the monthly slide based on M2 to M1?Thanks again for being such a resource on this!"

Yeah, I don't disagree and tbh, a lot of what you mention is in my base case too. I'm bullish for this year, even if that might not have come accross! (VIX < 20 and will stay below there, SPX hits 4500). You've prob listed all the reasons there. The only thing in the short-term is that the market is still somewhat coming to grips with this whole MMT experiment. We will just end up with an asset price bubble like you say, but I also think it might put some vol into US rates as investors look hard at the increasing debt, in turn prompting the FED to put in place YCC (US Treasury auction today and 10y yield +4bps, that's a 1.5sigma move on a 10y horizon). And in my mind until the market has found that new normal in rates, rates vol will be a thing and in a way can be the mother of all vol given the amount of assets and relative pricing it influences. So I am with you, but I just think it will take some more time for markets to really accept the new environment and probably for the Fed to really step up the YCC game before implied vols come lower across assets.Edit: formatting"

You can try to create a CIX, but it's tricky. You need to change the weightings of the front months vix futures every day, which is the hard part, i.e. CMF(T) = W1(T-1) * 1m fut(T) + W2(T-1) * 2m fut(T) with W1(T-1) = (M-N)/M with N=days passed in the current roll period and M=total days in the roll period and W2(T-1) = 1-W1(T-1) = N/M.

Yes, that will be correct for the DoD move, but will include the rolldown so won't give you a good idea of the CMF if you want to use that to see percentiles etc.I built something in python to work out the timeseries including the correct business day calc and the weightings, it's not hard but it's tedious."
