Now a car loan with the same credit is around 4% and mortgages are in the mid 2% range. Why? Shouldn't those rates maintain some kind of gap and move in relative lockstep?With sovereign bond yields being damn near nothing, is there a possibility that investors/institutions stop buying them altogether? I haven't checked bond trading volume (and wouldn't even know where to look honestly). What would the implications of such a move be and why are people still buying bonds?"

But that sub is dead. So asking here. Maybe someone can help.Something I'm not understanding in the IPO process.Basically - from what I understand - an IPO works like this. A company wants to raise money by going public. They hire an ibank as a market maker. The ibank goes to its clients (HNWIs, institutional investors, etc.) and says hey - this company wants to go public, here's a pitch deck of what the value prop is - would you like to invest? (Roadshow.) If there's enough interest, it will take the company public and pocket a % of the capital raised as a fee.Here's what I don't understand. Where exactly does the public come in?The company wishing to go public will have raised $ through the investors who bought in during the roadshow. When the stock gets listed those investors will be under a lock up period. From what I understand the ibank will also underwrite or guarantee a certain number of shares will sell by buying up the spread between what the roadshow investors buy and the target # of shares the company wishes to sell. Where then, does the public money go? Does it go back to the ibank? When the stock opens for trading and the public buys shares what's happening? The company has already raised its money. The ibank (if the deal wasn't fully subscribed) may be on the hook for a little bit. But is the ibank the other side of the deal when you and I buy stock? If so, at what point does the ibank stop receiving a % of the stock transactions? Is that part of the lockup agreement?"

People would try to get rid of items useless to them but they would not accept every gift from others but only most valuable or useful ones. Also people would try to make the ratio of care-stones to gift given to them as big as possible, so would rather accept big package of material with one care-stone than small one etc.I was just thinking about concept of gift economy reverse money. Money is mostly social practice or institution based on shared trust right? I was just thinking maybe we could come up with different kind of practice than we curently have. Could the above mentioned system function and be based on players trust? There is not meant to be any outside party forcing people to follow the rule about care-stones. People are meant to follow the rule about care-stone out of their own understanding of its beneficency. Would players have motivation to engage in that system? My idea was that players know that if the gift economy moves, they benefit from it because they get rid of what they dont need and acquire what they do need. Player could arive at idea that system will work only if other players will believe it will work and in the same time he could see them ariving at the same idea and his own yet unknown believe being constructive for saturation of their believe, therefore he would see it is not sure it would work but it can only work if he decides to try it and take a leap of faith.New care-stones could be generated automaticaly simmlary to bitcoin, either deflating or inflating."

Risk that they cannot even cover themselves.So the end result of all of this is likely going to be that every single investment bank in the country with exposure to this risk, which could be every single investment bank in the country, is forcibly liquidated. It’s an even worse situation for the banks than the housing crash because in 2008 their level of exposure was actually limited, in this situation it is theoretically UNlimited.

I googled around and didn't really find a clear definition for this particular term.My understanding though is that the loan is recorded as a liability because the bank wrote a check for the disbursement and someone could come cash the check on demand at any time."

BP and Shell both have had huge revenue drops since the first wave of the pandemic this was to me was obvious. But now so many people are testing in the financial markets because they have expendable cash flow not because they are clever investors. And because historically if you invest in a crash you make lots of money.The financial markets are savage on the people that perhaps don’t play the safe game is that our Achilles heel.To invest in China is madness no one can trust the figures. the companies who hold the most value are state owned and the Chinese government just keeps on printing money without acceptable Accountancy indicators on their accounts.Effectively Chinese companies could pluck a figure from the sky and say that’s what they are and no one can indicate whether those returns are factual because of the tight financial restraints held by the government.Major US companies have held onto liquid cash to increase the value of the dollar many streams are flowing upwards and not being re-distributed as they don’t need to because they hold such strong product and marketing expertise.No one is talking about state owned Debt.The UK government is talking about Negative interest rates. This only hurt the people with the least propensity to save as the companies have Hoardedcash since the last financial economic crash.This was due simply to D risking.So what’s my point well many of the majors haven’t started to ask their suppliers for cost reductions so that they can keep their shareholders happy with the high returns they saw a few years ago also most corporations haven’t released their financial statements especially at the lower 350 FTSE mark.The markets are still propped up by government and sovereign fund intervention and people that do have money I still throwing it at stupid stocks.no one has been reporting on the losses and riveters market which is worth five times that of all the companies that exist so what are the losses if you hedged on oil another 68% drop even if you manage to risked what are the losses still a lot of those derivatives have not been paid out yet a lot of those people will not until the year and declare losses even the small business"

Big win or risky bet? I just read that Warner Music Group is going to obtain the Canadian founded meme page Daquan.As part of a larger purchase in buying the media group IMGN Media. So, they're putting up a crazy number like $85M USD to purchase the meme page in order to expand their own marketing and social media presence. What do you think would happen if after the deal goes through, everyone just unfollowed the page? One could assume Warner put up that kind of cash to secure an audience immediately, and perhaps push their own agenda or promotional venues. In my mind, if people just unfollowed the page they would outright lose money right? I'm curious to know if this will pay off in the future or be a substantial loss for Warner.Source: Calgary Herald"

The 30 year Treasury bill is much lower than it was 5 years ago. This reflects mortgage rates being lower now.Typically, you don't see mortgages having higher rates than car loans. I've never seen car loans in the 2% range honestly. I can't speak to this specific circumstance. I do know that car loan rates are higher because they are set at the prime rate, which is typically 3% higher than the feds fund rate.However, the interest on car loans and mortgage loans being much closer can be explained by the yield curves flattening and even inversing for a short awhile. Investopedia is a great resource for learning about different formations of yield curves. It has its criticisms for being a predictor of recessions, but there is correlation there. People continue to buy bonds in high risk environments because it is considered to be a safe asset. Uncertainty causes people to flood bonds in a demand wave. This causes bond rates to go down and prices of bonds to go up. For bonds, price of the bond and yield of the bond have inverse relationships. I know yields are low right now, but it's better to gain 1% rather than lose 20% in the mind of a more cautious investor expecting the worst."

The yield curve flattened significantly. 2. House prices increased, reducing the risk of the underlying of the mortgage while car sales slumped, increasing the risk there. As a result you see tge rates you saw.For one, negative nominal rates do not mean negative real rates. The markets are likely pricing in deflation. Secondly, as mentioned before, institutions have mandates regarding asset allocation. Some may stop buying as they have mandates requiring positive yields, others don't care.

More importantly, company shares are now publicly available, meaning the share value theoretically will be dictated by free market supply and demand. Even more importantly, the company itself must also make MANY more public disclosures about its financials and outlook, amongst other things. Where then, does the public money go? Does it go back to the ibank?This is a great question (if I'm interpreting what you really want to ask correctly). It depends on what the type of sale the underwriter has agreed to (wiki this later). Long story short, this is often the relationship side of the process, as the underwriter will often have a list of clients who will make offers that may or may not be hard offers. In a bought deal, the underwriter physically owns the shares, so the exchange of shares to client is straightforward. In a traditional bookrun deals, it's based on offers from clients, who may or may not pay for the shares in advance. Depending on the agreement between underwriter and issuer, money from these investors ultimately either goes directly to the issuer or to the underwriter (if the underwriter has already hard purchased the shares from the issuer). When the stock opens for trading and the public buys shares what's happening? But is the ibank the other side of the deal when you and I buy stock? If so, at what point does the ibank stop receiving a % of the stock transactions? Is that part of the lockup agreement?Not sure what exactly you're asking. After the shares hit the exchange, whoever is the OWNER of the shares of the stock is the other side of the deal when you and I try to buy stock. It could be the bank that's selling you shares, but you very likely won't know. Lockup agreements have absolutely nothing to what you've mentioned."

This stands for NET Asset Value. So here is where the ETF fees are deducted from. Say a fund holds 100% AAPL in its portfolio and charges you 0.50% ANNUAL expense ratio. Beginning of the year, let's say the fund has a total 100 shares issued trading at 100 dollars, so $10,000 total NAV beginning of the year. You buy ALL 100 shares of this fund for $10,000, and this fund is invests all it's funds in AAPL (so $10k worth of AAPL). End of year, let's say AAPL has stayed the EXACT same price. You're thinking to yourself, ok so my 100 shares in this fund should be the same value right? No. Your 100 shares of the fund is worth $9,950 instead of your expected $10,000 because you needed to pay $50 worth of expenses. The NAV of the fund at the end of the year is $9,950, even though it's holding $10,000 worth of AAPL stock. This fee are usually deducted daily from NAV prorated (i.e 0.50%/250 * Average assets for the day). Here's the kicker. People might STILL pay $100 per share ON THE MARKET for that fund, even though its NAV suggests only $99.50 per share. So this is why you might be confused, because you're looking at the market price for the ETF and not its NAV. Also when people say the expense ratio compounds what does that mean? Simply put, if an expense ratio is fixed for the fund, as the fund appreciates, you will pay more $ amount in expenses. 0.50% of 10k is obviously less expensive than 0.50% of 50k, which would happen if AAPL increased by 5X (using the same example). Same logic applies to a savings account, only difference is you'd be benefitting from the compounding vs. paying it."

If you need the accuracy, you can use a yield curve to run your DCF with a term structure of rates, but I think most of the time you can just use the rate that corresponds the term of the asset (ie. use the 10 year rate if it is a DCF over 10 years) and ignore the interim term structure.

I don't know how familiar you are with valuation, so I'll give you a link to his beginner book on Google books, and his website.Statistics route focuses more on performance metrics, and how stocks work together to manage risk and generate growth. ETFs use this route the most. Since you have a background in math I'd recommend going to something like ETF.com and looking at the methodologies behind Smart Beta ETFs and/or their indices. I'll provide you with USMV (iShares Minimum Volatility) as an example. Their index is the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility index. You can find the methodology in a PDF link on the MSCI website. Once you get a handle on this you can try making your own portfolios with different factors. For risk management, this link for basic risk management metrics is a good starting point.

And pays to the company the capital the company wants to raise. (Which reduces the financing risk but also reduces the amount of $ the company could raise by letting the markets hash out the fair price. On the other hand - it also puts a backstop on the loss if the company let's the markets hash out the price and the market believes the company's value proposition is dog shit.)In contrast - when there is a preliminary prospectus filing, the underwriter DOESN'T buy the issuing company's stock. Then the company's valuation is at the mercy of the market. (But again, backstopped to some extent by the underwriter.)That's all super helpful and may help better frame my question -Basically what I'm trying to ask is - presumably, if the company takes the latter route and files for a preliminary prospectus, how does the company ensure that it receives the money it raises?I think I answered my own question - Basically, when trading starts, the sell side of the shares are all owned by the issuing company. When you or I buy shares, the money we spend (rather than being transferred to a private owner) is transferred to the company's treasury account, thereby raising the money.Bonus follow up question - How much of the stuff about roadshows is correct? Do IPOs typically raise some mix of the money through private placements as well? Pre-prospectus shopping? Or is this only applicable to private fundraising?"

It's a one time thing. Before the first trading day starts, the shares will already NOT belong to the issuer. In sum, the issuer will already raised that amount (minus fees) from the underwriter. If the underwriter and the issuer can't agree on this number, IPO fails to go through. How much of the stuff about roadshows is correct? Literally, the roadshow is just a marketing effort that serves as a mutual way to gauge interest between issuer and buyers. Relationships are EXTREMELY important at this phase for obvious reasons, and many times a syndication of underwriters will help with this. Do IPOs typically raise some mix of the money through private placements as well? Pre-prospectus shopping? Or is this only applicable to private fundraising? For starters, an IPO is the exact opposite of a private placement. The vast majority of companies filing for IPO will have raised some sort of money beforehand through private placements (i.e your VC alphabets Series A,B,C, etc). Once a company is public, the simple rule is that you cannot raise money through private placement anymore. This point here is very key. While the underwriter won't change the price once it's declared, WHO the underwriter allocates shares to will be a factor. Hence, even if the shares are available to the public, it's often not really true because the underwriter will simply prefer to allocate the shares to it's own network of clients/institutional investors who they want to maintain a relationship with."

Whether you pay more than the actual net amount in the fund is the price of the ETF, which based on market supply and demand. In this situation, let's simplify by saying the AAPL price stays the same forever. You will then ALWAYS see the NAV of the fund decrease (Asset amount stays the same, but expenses still there), but the PRICE of the ETF may or may not decrease. In short, expenses affect the NAV of the ETF, which in turn may or may not affect the price of the ETF. In efficient market times, NAV and price of the ETF should close to each other, so that's when expenses will be reflected in the price (i.e price of ETF reflects the true NAV of the fund)."

If it is prior to expiration your only choices to exit are either sell the options if there is a bid, or exercise and take the shares. At expiration this doesn’t work like a standard gamma play because if option are in the money you’re just trading stock, if at the money they are basically binary options, and if out of the money they are nothing. If you (or a collective you) have enough capital you can move prices. This is neither surprising nor unusual. Trade execution and slippage has long been a major issue for large institutions and is the main motivation for the creation of dark pools. There is nothing magic about buying call options. To the extent there is a matched book you will meet selling interest. If your trade is big enough to exhaust selling interest you will start to move price and your synthetic leverage will manifest in the rebalancing of market makers as delta increases. For most traders this is undesirable as it increases your execution price. Not to mention it most likely drives bid ask spreads wider as you consume liquidity. If the trader is actually a collective of small individual traders it has the same high level market impact but an interesting wrinkle in that the early entrants know there are bids behind them and can choose to sell and take gains.

I can put all 50k in $B2. I can short $A for 50k and do nothing with $B, I'd then have 100k cash.3. I can short $A for 50k then take the new value of 100k and put that in $B since generally you don't need to hold cash as collateral for a short position.Would you not say option 3 is the best for the economy and society since I essentially move value from $A to $B?Now granted not everyone is into shorting for such altruistic reasons. You could simply think that in a pair of competitors one will do better than the other. E.g. $AMD is going to do better than $INTC, so you'd buy $AMD and short $INTC.I think one thing people may forget or not realize is the money to get from short selling usually doesn't just sit there doing nothing; it usually gets put into another company since you don't need cash as collateral generally, owning stock in other companies is perfectly fine collateral.I don't know exactly what you'd call explorative or mass market manipulation, but the examples above are some of the most common reasons shorts are entered and wouldn't qualify as either imo."

To extrapolate further, shorting a stock isn't going to put direct pressure on a company (since it's not going to affect the company's financial health), whereas high interest expenses will be DEFINITELY felt by a company.

There is some confusion because Citadel Securities is one of the largest market makers in public equities and Citadel Investment Group is one of the largest investors in the hedge fund space, but they are different entities.Market makers will pay for certain types of order flow, specifically retail flow from brokers like Robhinhood, Schwab, Ameritrade, etc because it tends to be a lot of small, uncorrelated orders. The market maker earns a bid/offer spread every time they round trip buy/sell. But they take some risk if they end up with a directional position and the price moves before they complete the other side. Big institutions tend to move prices with their orders and/or have some informational advantage whereas retail trades usually have neither of these risk. So if market makers can fill a lot of retail orders they get a very low risk way to earn the bid offer, to the extent that they can even share some of the profits via payment for this order flow (and also offer better execution at the same time.)"

Your earnest money also goes towards the down payment. If you're buying a $100k house, you might have $1k earnest money due at the time of the contract signing, and probably $3k - $4k in closing costs, taxes, and insurance. Let's just call it $4k for sake of hypotheticals. Your total money out of pocket is your $3k down payment and $4k closing costs, taxes, and insurance or $7k total. You'll pay $1k in earnest money up front. You'll probably pay another ~$500 to the mortgage company to order an appraisal. So you'll have prepaid $1,500 of your $7k and you'll need to bring a check for $5,500 to closing. You'll also need to pay for an inspection and that will be another $300-$600 that you'll need to pay that is outside the $7k needed for the mortgage."

How do you identify the people who did on a class basis without conducting “mini-trials” to establish class membership, much less reliance?  Not possible.  If the class is defined as GME investors altogether, then even more blatant problems present themselves to certify a class.  Further, he is facing a catch-22 suddenly.  He would be worse off in my view had he actually disclosed that he was a CFA/FINRA subject, because that might actually create ambiguity re. the capacity in which he was posting.  There is no ambiguity, however, because he was an anonymous Reddit user who simply posted his positions and provided YT videos with analysis about why he liked his positions.  As far as I know, nobody ever knew or understood that he was a CFA/FINRA subject, or otherwise acting in any capacity other than as an individual who was distinct and separate from any broker-dealer.  He wasn’t receiving commissions.  He was sharing knowledge and analytical education in good faith.  No pumping.  No dumping.  This Class Action is trying to lever the fact that he went out of his way to avoid ambiguity and reliance in this respect, by alleging that he purposefully took on a lay-person persona on WSB and YT.  What a joke.  Obviously, anyone who actually followed WSB and the progress of DFV’s YOLO Updates (which were DOWN significantly at various times) knows full well that he acted in good faith, and was not manipulating (or trying to manipulate) any person or the underlying SP of GME.  The market created conditions that were objectively true (heavy weighted short interest, and solid assets, entrenched brand in growing industry, and legitimate growth prospects if well executed, etc.) I hope this case is dismissed immediately for failure to I sure hope this case is dismissed quickly for failure to state a claim.  DFV’s lawyers need to be careful in their motion to dismiss, however, to make clear that the facts as alleged are being taken as true for purposes of the motion only, and without taking an actual position as to the facts because of the catch-22 noted above.I feel for him.

I do not have clients, and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions. I am an individual investor. My investment in GameStop and my posts on social media were entirely my own. I did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for my own profit. I did not belong to any groups trying to create movements in the stock price. I never had a financial relationship with any hedge fund. I had no information about GameStop except what was public. I did not know any people inside the company, and I never spoke to any insider.”  “As an individual investor, I use publicly available information to study the market and the value of specific companies. I consider a complex array of factors and track hundreds of stocks – all in search of market inefficiencies. Like many people, sometimes I post on social media my thoughts and analysis about individual stocks and whether they are correctly valued.”  “In April 2019, I accepted a marketing and financial education job at MassMutual. My job was to help develop financial education classes that advisors could present to prospective clients. I never sold securities, and I was not a financial advisor.”“I continued analyzing stocks on my own time and investing my family’s funds. The investment I made was risky, but I was confident in my analysis, and I was willing to accept the loss if I was proven wrong.”  “My investment skills had reached a level where I felt sharing them publicly could help others. I also thought that by sharing my own ideas and accepting critiques, I would be able to identify holes in my analysis. Hedge funds and other Wall Street firms have teams of analysts working together to compile research and critique investment ideas, while individual investors have not had that advantage. Social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and WallStreetBets on Reddit are leveling the playing field.”  ”I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel. Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis – my focus was on the fundamentals of the business.”  “As for what happened in January, others will have to explain it. Threshold lists, order flow, halting purchases – according to the media these all had a material impact on GameStop stock in January. Here’s the thing: I’ve had a bit of experience and even I barely understand these matters. It’s alarming how little we know about the inner-workings of the market. I believe an analysis of GameStop’s recent price action must start with a discussion of the exorbitant short interest in the stock, as well as an investigation into any potentially manipulative shorting practices and brokers’ reported failures to timely deliver shares and settle trades.”"

It wouldn’t cost too much to run a Motion to Dismiss, Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, or Demurrer (depending on the court), but those are disfavored motions. I would say if he got lucky and won such a motion early on, he could get out of the case for as little as $25K. If he has to go further and run a Motion for Summary Judgment, it would be much more (maybe $100K). If he has to do discovery on top of that, even more. Taking it through trial really depends on how crazy things get. He has some options to try to get the plaintiff on the hook to pay his fees or costs, if he wins, but that guy probably would never pay."

In short, back in 2019 Revlon took an aggressive read of their credit docs and moved collateral away from the lenders (i.e. trap door, WSJ). The lenders argued that the action constituted a default and therefore they sued to accelerate payment on the entire loan. While this seems like a pretty clear operational error from Citi and I'm sure none of the lenders actually believed Revlon would repay the accelerated loan, the lenders have a decent theoretical defense in that they'd sued for repayment (and then received that repayment). Also as far as goodwill among market participants - there is none here. Revlon screwed over its creditors by moving assets away from them, the creditors are screwing over Citi for a mistake that gets them out of the Revlon risk.

For one, it wasn't even citi's loan. It's more like my bank  accidentally wired my full mortgage balance off to another bank on behalf of me. Then the other bank saying, sorry bro, we were expecting that. I sort of doubt another bank wouldn't return it, as the amount is relatively small and they want to keep good relationships. Except it's worse than that in this case. A random customer could conceivably pay off a mortgage in full. This was a troubled publicly traded company who couldn't pay off the full balance if they wanted to and wouldn't even if they could. The receiver of the 500M payment could literally look up Revlon's balance sheet and see they didn't have anywhere near enough cash to pay it off early. Further, they knew it was an error as soon as they received it, as big business never prepays a loan for almost the size of their entire market cap. Their internal comments indicated they knew it was an error immediately.The only reason the money wasn't returned was the magnitude of the error was worth more than the banking relationship and the fact that the bond went bad so they'd prefer not to have it. They took a calculated risk to fight it in court to capitalize on citi's error instead of being a decent human and rectifying someone's fat finger error. The discharge-for-value-defense is to prevent annoyance issues of random customer's coming back and asking for $1k of their $2k back. 500m prepayments aren't everyday occurrences at this place, which is why they noticed it immediately and joked about it.  It's also to prevent people who couldn't conceivably have known something was given to them in error from having to come up with money they now already spent. The law exists to prevent harm to the receiver of the erroroneous payment. The reason the law exists doesn't apply in this case. I know the judge  can't really weigh the reason a law exists too heavily, but it's not fair. Yes, legally they got away with it on a technicality, but it goes against all common sense. It was completely unethical and extremely scummy, imo."

From the article:“After all, the money accidentally wired was the exact amount to the penny Citibank owed them, although the loan wasn't set to mature for quite some time.”So it’s very plausible to think Citi was getting the loan off of the books and gave funding at an expedited time frame. Do I actually believe that? Of course not. Revlon saw the mistaken deposit was close enough to the loan amount for plausible deniability and spent it instantly.To the people posting “doesn’t this damage a business relationship?” Revlon is an investment advisory fund. They allocate money to make more money. They do not care if it’s Citi, BofA, or the federal government. They just want more capital and were gifted 2 years worth at one time.

I found good strategy 7 years ago what bring me 30x times more than I invest…For example in 1 month I was able to make from $1 000 ->>> $30 000 but I had big problem with risk control so I was keep losing all money again and again. Later I learn at least not losing my invested amount… Then I quit trading and moved to telecommunications business. I was generating huge income in telecommunications but my partners created scam scheme and scammed me on $900k and I didn’t have any choose so decide to close everything..After that something changed in my mind and I understand that my biggest problem in my life is risk control… I’m able to generate huge income but not able to control this assets.. SO I learn money management and return back to Forex.At moment I’m trading currency every day. I close in average 10–20 trades daily(all in profit). Not losing capital and growing every day. In average I make 10% per month without risk of losing my capital. As well I have created own affiliate web store what bring passive income. As I always need to do something.. trading become boring :) but it’s super profitable.Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm

I get interest on my BTC and ETH. I stake DOT elsewhere.You're implicitly posing the joint hypothesis question - but perhaps you should be skeptical of thinking you know more than the market.Maybe you should consider the economics of why such an asset demands a commensurate interest rate. I'll give you a hint - demand and supply. The entire crypto market thrives on using fiat collateral. It's hard to get that collateral onto the platform. High demand and low supply = high prices!Wasn't that fun and easy? There's no need for conspiracy theories with economics!And btw, gemini is insured and keeps its assets in cold storage, and gemini (not blockfi) is the custodian of assets. Retail banks are dead.

Deception would be if people were told that this was a sure thing. It was a squeeze that did affect the hedge funds. As far as I know, the stock only fell because of the trading restrictions that were put in place. People who had large gains were continuing to hold. The manipulation is with the trading platforms.

Anyone with a brain knew that short squeezes don't last very long precisely because people decide to cash out. Just like how shorters can get squeezed by buying in and inflating the price even higher, those who sell in high quantities can drag the price lower. You're debating semantics at this point. It 100% is deception whether you realize it or not. Saying people should have been aware of the risk doesn't excuse that. That community went from 500k users to 8.5 million within a couple of weeks. The reason the squeeze was even allowed to happen was because there weren't many shares to be sold in the market once Reddit pushed a mass buying and other institutions who held GME decided to hold. So no, it wasn't just one or two retail traders. It was Reddit starting a momentum that ended up deceiving thousands of people. A large percentage of Americans purchased a meme stock during this cycle. Do you honestly think the people who figured out about the over shorting by hedge funds really cared about sticking it to the hedge funds? And yet, that was all we heard 90% of the time.

Pulling your money out was always an option from what I saw. Continuing to assume risk is your choice.Being aware of the risk is part of the disclaimer that trading platforms use. Once you give the warning, the user is on their own. The increase in Reddit users speaks to what I was saying. It wasn't millions of people putting in every dollar they have. There were a lot of people putting in small amounts, and some big players that have been holding for years. Combined they created volatility. I haven't heard anyone say that this was fraudulent though. Pumping stock is done in the media every day and people make their buying decisions based on it. Is that deception?"

This is why you mainly saw free brokerages like RobinHood or WeBull halt their trading. Many individuals were purchasing GME on margin accounts and the collateral was increased because if the stock prices tank, RobinHood would be held liable to make up the deficit. It gets complicated explaining it but most retail traders signing up for RobinHood or any brokerage don't understand how trades are processed. A brokerage is mainly a middleman. The reason institutions could still buy or sell is precisely because these institutions aren't using RobinHood. RobinHood provides no benefit to institutional investors. Not every brokerage halted trading but the reason RobinHood was the biggest name mentioned is because RobinHood is the most popular free trading brokerage for new and retail investors. The average person might not but you need to ask yourself why was Reddit being mentioned if this had very little to do with the average person? It's because regardless of how you may choose to believe it, GameStop didn't have much open float in the market and a huge band of Reddit individuals + institutional investors who didn't sell made it possible. The simple fact that the community grew from 500k to 8.5 million users within two weeks should tell you just how much market power Reddit had in terms of GME. Let's just say on average that 10% of the subreddit had purchased GME with an average # of shares at 10. That's 8.5 million shares. And that's me being generous with the average # of shares. Some may have owned 1 when they purchased it at $200-$300 but there were a ton of people who purchased upwards of thousands of shares at $30-$50. That's 8.5 million shares. There are a total of 47 million share float. If you add in the institutional investors, then there simply wasn't enough shares which is why the price skyrocketed. High demand, low supply. Someone was buying them and the trend started on Reddit. It doesn't take a genius to see that there was more than enough market power than you're estimating. Look, I'm not going to in-depth about the meaning of deception. People are dumb and couldn't resist the gains that were plastered all over the media because of a supposed war vs hedge funds. That's where the deception started. You're simply stating that there is a risk to investing. Sure, no one disputes that. These people who lost money have zero case to retrieve their losses. The point is, they were deceived by others in some shape or form mainly to continue holding as it would continue 'skyrocketing' and when the individuals who had enough shares began unloading to take profit, it went downhill and there was no more 'HOLD HOLD HOLD.' Once again, I'm not disputing the risk. My point is these individuals were being misled the entire time. You have to be SERIOUSLY misled to purchase GME at $300 because no one in their right mind would consider that an investment. Debating semantics isn't really helping anyone here. Yeah, the media deceives individuals every day. What's your point? Deception isn't illegal. People are entitled to their opinions. It still doesn't change the fact that people were deceived at the end of the day which is why many have suffered losses while the very few have gained significantly. Anyways, I'm not really interested in dragging this along. It was a deliberate scam since the beginning masqueraded as a war vs hedge funds because that was the only way people were going to be supportive of pushing GME. Like I've already stated, the early people knew GME was going to tank eventually. They never once mentioned it because if they did, it would have never climbed the way it did."
6.66704847e+17,42447000.0,Rizilus,GameStop's top investor during the wild Reddit-fueled trading frenzy has dumped nearly all of its stake,Reddit_finance_2021-02-18.csv,REDDIT,COM,"I get that with Robinhood, but I'm saying that preventing retail investors from trading is the only manipulation that I see here. It seems to me that Robinhood would have prevented both buying and selling if they were worried about the stock tanking. A massive sell-off from Robinhood users would create more volatility.I learned about this through Reddit, and the message that the stock could/would tank was everywhere. Small investors that joined the hype knew they were putting in money that they could lose. I didn't see anyone that was surprised about the risk. I just don't see where there was a scam. No one went into this with no idea what could happen.I think Reddit was all over the media because it's a good story. It's a small corner of the internet that was originally full of people with plenty of money to invest who did their research. It grew because of the media, but that's after GME had been a topic there for a long time. I don't think one group on Reddit is capable of causing wild swings in the market when billions are being lost or gained by institutional investors. Hedge funds can affect the market though, and Reddit was able to affect them. That was the problem. It was the retail investors having influence on them that needed to be stopped. If retail investors had lost out while the hedge funds made billions, I don't think it would have been a story or seen as an issue."

Can even lead to fraud as managers try to hit impossible targets (e.g. Theranos).Additionally, it's usually better to sacrifice some equity (accept a lower valuation) for higher quality investors and better deal terms. That is another reason why valuations are sometimes lower than you might expect."

It's a bird in the hand thing - you might get burned in the future if you set valuation too high, but you definitely give up extra value today if you don't do it. Also, a company which has gone through several priced rounds already typically has pressure from existing investors (who may even have board seats) to push valuation higher because that allows them to mark their positions higher. To your second point, strategic partner investors will sometimes get better valuation because they can bring other advantages to the table, but it's not clear to me who would be likely strategic partners for Reddit."

Very annoying with long comments.Most of the comments start off collapsed on mobile, and they're frustratingly small to click.Often when navigating back or scrolling, the page just completely crashes and refreshes, you lose your position, and have to uncollapse all the comments again.It's not surprising that it's optimized for scrolling through many posts, rather than long discussions.

I relied on third party apps for that (long time user of Narwhal on tablet, and various phone clients)On a table today I actually use the webapp, but instead of opening multiple tabs I use one main tab and back button.

All else isn’t equal. You don’t have that much say over how much equity you give up if the actual thing you need is the $100m. How much equity you give away isn’t really a choice, so much as whatever the best deal you can cut in order to secure the $100M is. If the investor you have interested says that they will only invest $100M in exchange for 20% equity for example, and you say yes, then your valuation becomes $500M. If you say you only are willing to give up 10% equity, then they are either a) only going to invest $50M because both parties at these point have somewhat established that the valuation should be around $500M at that point, or b) say they’re uninterested in only investing $50M for 10% because they would only see half the potential financial returns and have fewer voting shares to ensure their investment (or c) some other option). It’s a very fluid and very psychological situation. But you should always have the goal of losing as little equity as possible, since the moment you no longer have 51% it’s no longer your company. So that’s the balancing act. It’s like what can you and the investors agree upon, how can you hold anything as a lever to move around as you negotiate, and it’s very hard to backtrack on one element as the negotiation develops because previously you were saying that thing was true."

So this is my challenge to you, look up the numbers yourself. Only 2-3% of the nation actually earns minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage is effectively lowering everyone else's pay which goes hand in hand with my previous statement, real wages have doubled since the peak of minimum wage in the 60's.
