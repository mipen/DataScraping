6.673872e+17,1ronnie,Its Over,"Lance is absolutely right, reason to be bearish is because no one is. Remember I posted Sentiment Traders twit below and remarked that the reason Volume is Extreme High even though Volatility is low is because there is no fearThe lack of fear is more likely to prompt a sudden bout of fear when an event unfolds as falls start to crystallise, bring about a swift and sudden jolt to the market to the downside.I am not short (I dont short as I said a million times) nor am I in Bear ETFs- my way of protection is simply moving to the sidelines (like I did months before the COVID crash) and stay resolute while we continue to see flashes of green as the party continues oblivious to the risk(s) it is about to encounter.This is a thread of Opportunity and Caution - there will be a time I start highlighting opportunity again , it may as early as a month or two who knows or it may be for some time yet.The Only Reason To Be Bearish Is No One Is BearishBy Lance Roberts of Real Investment AdviceMonday, February 22, 2021 10:05 AM ESTI had to do a double-take recently when reading a CNBC headline that stated: The only reason to be bearish is there’s no reason to be bearish.It is indeed hard to argue the point. As the article explained:A majority of investors finally agree the V-shaped recovery is at play, according to the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey. Plus, a record percentage of money managers believe that global growth is at an all-time high.Key FindingsMore than 90% of investors believe the economy will be more robust in 2021, with a consensus it’s a V-shape recovery. For the first time since January 2020, chief investment officers want to increase capital spending rather than improve balance sheets.Fund managers’ allocation to cash is down to 3.8%, the lowest since March 2013. Such was just before the taper tantrum era under former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.Allocations to stocks and commodities are the highest since February 2011.The survey shows a preference towards cyclical stocks, high exposure to commodities, emerging markets, industrials, and banks relative to the past 10-years.Only 13% of respondents said stocks are in a bubble.As the survey notes:Stocks are hovering around all-time highs as investors bet on a successful rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, economic reopening, and expectations for more fiscal stimulus.What could go wrong? 3-Risks In 2021According to [Hyman] Miskey, events leading up to a crisis start with a ‘displacement,’ some exogenous, outside shock to the macroeconomic system. The nature of this displacement varies from one speculative boom to another. An unanticipated change to monetary policy might constitute such a displacement. Some economists who think markets have it right and governments wrong, blame ‘policy switching for some financial instability. – Charles KindlebergerWhile it is clear that a speculative mania exists, such will remain the case until an exogenous event creates financial instability. As the survey noted, there are risks to the outlook.Investors say potential risks include the vaccine rollout, inflation, crowded trades in tech, long bitcoin trades, and shorting the dollar trades.Given ample evidence that everyone is in the pool, markets are vulnerable to 3-risks.More stimulus and direct checks into the economy lead to an inflationary spike that causes an anticipated monetary policy change.The current rise in interest rates continues with rising inflation until it impacts a debt-laden economy. Such would force the Fed to implement yield curve control. The dollar, which has an enormous net-short position against it, reverses and moves higher, pulling in foreign reserves, causing a short-squeeze on the dollar. The reality is that all three could be a simultaneous problem. Given the high correlation between inflation and interest rates, higher yields will attract reserves from countries faced with economic weakness and negative-yielding debt. Such would lead to a stronger dollar quickly reversing the tailwinds that have supported the equity rally since March.The Dollar RiskWe think this is potentially the most significant risk we face currently and something we noted just recently.The one thing that always trips of the market is the one thing that no one is paying attention to. For me, that risk lies with the US Dollar. As noted previously, everyone expects the dollar to continue to decline, and the falling dollar has been the tailwind for the emerging market, commodity, and equity ‘risk-on’ trade. Whatever causes the dollar to reverse will likely bring the equity market down with it.Very quietly, the dollar has been rising and recently broke above and successfully held its 50-dma. With a substantial net short position outstanding, a further rise could trigger shorts to begin covering, pushing the dollar up further.As noted, such would not support equity markets due to the non-correlation between the dollar and equities. Most importantly, a surging dollar, with rising interest rates, could put a severe dent in the reflation trade. The Problem With Monetary PolicyThere is also the problem of monetary policy. As discussed in Moral Hazard, investors are chasing risk assets higher because they believe they have an insurance policy against losses, a.k.a. the Fed.However, this brings us to the one question everyone should be asking:If the markets are rising because of expectations of improving economic conditions and earnings, then why are Central Banks pumping liquidity like crazy?Central Bank interventions, while boosting asset prices may seem like a good idea in the short-term, in the long-term has harmed economic growth. As such, it leads to the repetitive cycle of monetary policy.Using monetary policy to drag forward future consumption leaves an enormous void that must get continually refilled in the future.Monetary policy does not create self-sustaining economic growth and therefore requires ever-larger amounts of monetary policy to maintain the same activity level.The filling of the gap between fundamentals and reality leads to consumer contraction and, ultimately, a recession as economic activity recedes.Job losses rise, the wealth effect diminishes, and real wealth gets destroyed. The middle class shrinks further.Central banks act to provide more liquidity to offset recessionary drag and restart economic growth by dragging forward future consumption. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.If you don’t believe me, here is the evidence.The stock market has returned more than 164% since the 2007 peak, which is more than 3.8x the growth in corporate sales, and 7.5x more than GDP.But, for the 10% of the population that owns 90% of the stock market, the sentiment is now getting extreme. The Problem With Low RatesHowever, whenever there is a discussion of valuations, it is invariably stated that low rates justify higher valuations. Maybe. But the argument suggests rates are low BECAUSE the economy is healthy and operating near full capacity. However, the reality is quite different, as the always insightful Dr. John Hussman pointed out:Make no mistake: the main contributors to the illusion of permanent prosperity have been decidedly cyclical factors.Again, when interest rates are low because growth is also low, no valuation premium is ‘justified’ at all. In the present environment, investors are inviting disastrous losses by paying the highest S&P 500 price/revenue ratio in history. They are also paying the highest median price/revenue ratio in history across S&P 500 component stocks (more than 50% beyond the 2000 peak, because extreme valuations in that episode were focused on much narrower subset of stocks than at present). Glorious past returns and record valuations are a Potemkin Village with a barren field behind it.Valuation measures suggest investments made today will not provide returns much above zero over the next decade.That is just the math.Lot’s Of ExuberanceSuch brings me to something Michael Sincere’s once penned:At market tops, it is common to see what I call the ‘high-five effect’ — that is, investors giving high-fives to each other because they are making so much paper money. It is happening now. I am also suspicious when amateurs come out of the woodwork to insult other investors.Michael’s point is very apropos, particularly today, given the more extreme allocations to equities by investors currently.The reality is that strongly rising asset prices, mainly driven by emotional exuberance, hide investment mistakes in the short term. Poor, or deteriorating fundamentals, excessive valuations, and rising credit risk often get ignored as prices increase. Unfortunately, it is only after the damage is done the realization of those risks occurs.As Michael stated:Most investors believe the Fed will protect their investments from any and all harm, but that cannot go on forever. When the Fed attempts to extricate itself from the market one day, that is when the music stops, and the blame game begins.No Reason To Be BearishIn every stock market cycle there is a dominant investor who captures the market’s zeitgeist by incorporating and reflecting the ideas and beliefs of the times. – Doug KassWhether it was the Janus 20 fund in the late ’90s or ARK Investments currently, there was always a belief this time was different, and some transformative technology had changed market dynamics.Currently, there seems to be no reason to be bearish on the markets. Rates are low, monetary policy is flowing, and there are hopes the economy will eventually recover. However, as noted, there are certainly risks to that outlook.It is important to remember that markets run in full cycles (up and down). While the bullish up cycle lasts twice as long as the bearish down cycle, the damage to investors is not a result of lagging markets as they arise but in capturing the inevitable reversion. Such is something I will discuss in more detail in an upcoming article.Currently, the markets are indeed in a liquidity-driven upcycle. With margin debt at records, stock prices in a near-vertical rise, and junk bond yields at record lows, the bullish media continues to suggest there is no reason for concern.Maybe There Is?But maybe that is just the reason to be concerned.The object of speculation may vary widely from one mania or bubble to the next. At a late stage, speculation tends to detach itself from really valuable objects and turn to delusive ones. A larger and larger group of people seeks to become rich without a real understanding of the processes involved. Not surprisingly, swindler and catchpenny schemes flourish. – KindlebergerWhen everyone is in the pool, it is an excellent time to remember a basic premise of investing from our post on trading rules: Opportunities are made up far easier than lost capital. – Todd Harris",51235447

If they make cash difficult to hold and transact or banning it altogether, they can have better control over money and they can introduce NIRP (negative interest rate policy) without worrying about people removing cash from their accounts to place in safe deposit boxes (like what the Europeans did).2) Digital dollar a threat to BTC - talk of digital dollar did cause BTC to drop3) YCC is under consideration so that must be why Gold is perking up 4) Yellen is setting herself up for the next major market event to be in a strong position to respond and defend .....because she knows too well the state of the financial system and its fragility and vulnerability.Central bankers now have no choice but to prop up financial assets with their ever low interest rate environment...and if it cant get low enough, then lets have negative interest rates. Too Big To Fail is a real threat to the entire financial system ....but propping up of financial assets can never sustain itself indefinitely and at some point, the house of cards will tumble if markets continued elevation diverges further from economic realities. With a digital dollar, the Fed no longer needs to print, it can just press a button to create new money in a jiffy. It could be setting a stage for a hyperinflationary environment to come. But first we will have deflation before inflation....the markets may be jumping the gun a bit sensing that COVID is on the decline with vaccination. We just cant be sure yet the COVID story is ending even though that is starting to be the narrative.Yellen Sets The Stage For Higher Corporate Taxes, Yield Curve Control And A Digital DollarBy Zero HedgeMonday, February 22, 2021 12:48 PM ESTIn comments made on Monday morning, Fed Chair Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen set the stage for several exciting new initiatives, including a higher corporate tax, potentially higher capital gains taxes, yield curve control... oh, and a digital dollar. Yellen came out in favor of boosting corporate taxes and said she was also open to raising capital gains taxes, during a Monday conference hosted by the New York Times. Yellen said that the Biden administration could boost the corporate tax rate to 28% to help pay for Biden’s planned longer-term economic reconstruction program. Such a hike in corporate taxes could immediately trigger profit taking in financial assets that have benefited from a low corporate tax rate (the one that, according to CNBC, was being priced in at least once a day for several entire years during the Trump administration). Despite this, she claimed that the Biden administration has not yet favored a wealth tax, news that will likely trigger AOC, Ilhan Omar, Elizabeth Warren, and the like. A wealth tax has been discussed but is not something President Biden, Yellen said on Monday.She also said a higher capital gains tax was worth considering. One would have to examine closely what effect it would have, she noted, referring to such a taxs effect on ordinary investors. As Bloomberg notes, one of the big challenges for the market will be any changes in tax policy toward a less-friendly regime. As we discussed late on Sunday, a Tobin tax (i.e., an HFT transaction tax) has been mentioned by the White House, although it will quickly die a quiet death as it would lead to a market-wide crash as the HFT liquidity moneymakers revolt. Incidentally, a hike to the capital gains tax could also lead to profit-taking on a whole host of assets if there’s a window to lock in the lower rate.Yellen also talked about the idea of looking at new ultra-long duration debt such as a 100-year bond in order to take advantage of low yields (her predecessor Steven Mnuchin did the same on several occasions before killing the idea), which Yellen doesnt seem to realize are low because the Fed has set them this low. Regardless, Yellen said she thinks a market for a 100-year bond would be very tiny and very thin. Perhaps most notable was Yellens reaffirmation that it makes sense for the Fed to look into the idea of a digital dollar - comments that potentially played a role in bitcoins early morning selloff which briefly saw the cryptocurrency crash 15% and fall under $50,000. The price has since risen back above $50,000 despite additional comments from Yellen that bitcoin was inefficient. In a tangent, Yellen said that she hadn’t anticipated an offer by Biden to become Treasury secretary, at a time when she was focusing on giving out $250,000 speeches to Citadel research while working at the Brookings Institution. Noting the round-the-clock stress of a job like helming the Treasury, the former Federal Reserve chair said, I was initially hesitant to get back into that. Biden then made the case on how she could be helpful, Yellen said.Finally, in confirming that yield curve control is coming one way or another, the only question is whether before or after 2.0% on the 10%...... Yellen offered up the amusing notion that debt interest payments are a better metric than debt to GDP. We wonder if this is because one metric is absolutely terrifying...(Click on image to enlarge)...while the other is directly controlled by the Fed and is currently at artificially all-time lows.",51235027

Is it well justified for ********* to be higher by 33pc vis_a-vis pre COVID levels in the current economic environment. Wouldnt the economic recovery story be already fully baked in in this 33pc in one YEAR? I would be surprised if the EPS of the collective ********* can make up a 33pc increase to pre COVID levels. So if that increase is not backed by EPS gains, then it is merely PE expansion or just speculative fluff, when the downdraft comes , we can only expect that premium to deflate and usually in bigger proportion to the larger caps. When we are in this game, we can be the casino high roller or the venture capitalist. Venture capitalist can make 10 long term bets and usually one or two large gains can more than overcome the remaining 8 or 9 that turned out to be duds. A casino high roller must know when to leave the table especially after having big gains, because staying in the game will inevitably result in giving back those gains and perhaps even more. Or we can be both , knowing when to leave the table and when risk reward favours a return to the game to pick up those great long term bets at even cheaper prices. The tricky bit is deciding which stocks and we know we will never get them all right. But more than usual, we become the venture capitalist by default rather than by design for some stocks when we start losing big and decide to ride out for the long term. The correctness of that decision lies in how your companys business progresses or the fortunes of the asset class rather than a belief that in the long term things will work out, as there are many penny stocks that never ever recovered or worse end in administration. So for the buyers of BIG as an example, the investor with the casino high roller mindset who bailed out early would have walked away with very decent gains while the investor with the venture capitalist mindset was in complete delusion that the stock he/she had in mind was a long term gem.",51230921

It was an exciting adventure in survival as our house’s temperature dropped below freezing and ice formed on our emergency water supply in the bathtub.However, between sitting in cars to charge the laptop and phone batteries and warm up a bit to figuring out how to make coffee on a gas stove, everyone made it through. The lesson we all relearned during this event is not to take for granted even the smallest luxuries in life or each other.This week’s newsletter will be abbreviated as I still don’t have access to everything just yet. However, by next week, we should be back to normal.Market Review & UpdateI previously stated that with the market already trading 2-standard deviations above the 50-dma, further upside could be limited. Such was the case as markets struggled all week to hold gains in a very narrow range. (Horizontal dashed lines.)Currently, the money flow signals remain positive, but sell signals did trigger as of the close on Friday. While the money flow itself remains strongly positive, the sell signals continue to suggest downward pressure on prices currently. However, given the more extreme overbought and bullish conditions, there is a risk of a deeper correction over the next few weeks.Importantly, as discussed last week, while we will certainly warn you of when our indicators turn lower, the problem remains two-fold:The indicators don’t distinguish between a 5% correction and a 20% drawdown; and,Secondly, the corrections often occur so quickly you don’t have much time to decide just how defensive you need to be. In other words, it is often advantageous to pare risk by leaving the party a little early. Are Rates About To Cause A ProblemThe question we need to answer is why the market has been struggling as of late. As we touched on last week, investors may be starting to factor in the twin threats of higher inflation and interest rates. To wit:With an economy pushing $85 trillion in debt, the entire premise of the ‘consumption function,’ as well as ‘valuation justification’ for the stock market, is based on low-interest rates. However, that is rapidly ending as the rise in rates is now approaching a danger zone for the markets.As discussed in our #Macroview report yesterday, interest rates are rapidly approaching the 1.5% to 2.0% barrier, where higher payments will collide with disposable income. Historically, such has not ended well for markets.The rise in interest rates is much more problematic than most suspect. Higher interest payments reduce capital expenditures, threatens refinancing, and spreads through the economy like a virus.As noted by Laura Cooper yesterday:The writing may soon be on the wall for the buy-everything-but-bonds rally, with focus on inflation fears and subsequent Fed tightening. Yet it’s rising real yields that might prove to be the ultimate stumbling block for the risk rally.Little Margin For ErrorHigher rates also quickly undermine one of the critical bullish supports of the last decade:In a heavily indebted economy, increases in rates are problematic for markets whose valuation premise relies on low rates.Each time rates have ‘spiked’ in the past; it has generally preceded a mild to a severe market correction.As is often stated, ‘a crisis happens slowly, then all at once.’So, how did the Federal Reserve get themselves into this trap?‘Slowly, and then all at once.’When combined with higher inflationary pressures due to stimulus injections, such becomes problematic. Higher borrowing costs and inflation compresses corporate profit margins and reduces real consumption as wages fail to increase commensurately.While the Fed continues to suggest they will let inflation run hot for a while, the problem is that the real economy won’t. The impacts of higher payments and costs will derail consumptive spending very quickly, given the real economy is still massively dependent on life support.Equally problematic is when the stock market suddenly realizes that higher rates have derailed a primary thesis of overpaying for value.Risk Appetite Is ExtremeIt seems as if with each passing week, we have continued to point out levels of exuberance either rarely or never, seen historically. This past week continues to see increasing levels of exuberance on many fronts.One that I will discuss more in Monday’s blog is the fact that no one is bearish. Of course, that may be reason enough to be concerned.As Bob Farrell once noted:When all experts agree, something else tends to happen.We must consider two issues.The first is that current levels of speculation have increased the risk of a more extreme reversion. As physics’ fundamental laws suggest, a rubber-band stretched to its limit will experience a move of equal intensity in the opposite direction.The second problem is the demise of the T.I.N.A. (There Is No Alternative) trade.The problem today is that the relationship between the 10 year US note yield and the S&P dividend yield has reversed. With risk-free rates of return rising, the 10 year US note now does provide an alternative – especially with the S&P dividend yield plummeting. – Doug KassWhen risk becomes realized, there is now a safe alternative.The shift will likely not be subtle.Portfolio UpdateFrom a portfolio management perspective, we have started to raise cash and reduce our equity risk somewhat. Our bond portfolio now has a very short duration, and high cash levels are acting as an early hedge against volatility.We are not getting overly aggressive on hedging risk just yet as the money flow indicators, as shown above, remain supportive. However, that signal is beginning to get more extended, and the market is starting to show early signs of deterioration.As I stated in the open, sometimes we need to act in advance of the correction. Such is particularly the case when there is excess speculation that can lead to very sharp single-day declines that make it extremely difficult to take appropriate actions amid a panic-driven sell-off.ConclusionImportantly, it is essential to remember that portfolio management is not about ALWAYS being right. It is about consistently getting on base that wins the game. There isn’t a strategy, discipline, or style that will work 100% of the time.The biggest investing errors come not from factors that are informational or analytical, but from those that are psychological. – Howard MarksThe biggest driver of long-term investment returns is the minimization of psychological investment mistakes. As an investor, it is merely your job to step away from your emotions for a moment. Look objectively at the market around you. Is it currently dominated by greed or fear? Your long-term returns will depend not only on how you answer that question but how you manage the inherent risk.Whether it is Paul Tudor Jones or any other great investor throughout history, they all had one core philosophy in common; the management of investing’s inherent risk.As many of those found out during the Gamestop saga:If you run out of chips, you are out of the game.",51190021

6.672198e+17,1ronnie,Its Over,"Facebook has the right to decide as it chose with regards to pulling out news content (because it didnt want to pay for it) because our Government policy allowed it to do so. That is being fair if you want to use the free to choose argument, and I would have said too that a more effective way would be to impose a Government tax on digital platforms. But while Facebook is free to choose, it does not mean it is right, it is not, it meant that Facebook is willing to put profits before community, while it is worried that succumbing to our Australian Governments first-to-do policy to mandate social media platforms to pay for news content would cause a precedent that would be further adopted by countries around the world, now it has to contend with a loss of its franchise reputation and at worse giving the perfect excuse for the anti-trust movement in US to break them apart. As I often said in this thread, free to choose is not always right. This circumstance with Facebook showed that Facebooks right to choose is myopic and true and true reflects the character of its founder. The guy who said the people in his Harvard campus willing to share their personal data with him when he was starting out FB as dumb farks !  And when it comes to this pandemic, it is yet another circumstance that free to choose may be ones right but not always the best outcome. The same goes with freedom of speech advocates when in certain circumstances, it is yet again not a good outcome. We should judge this freedom based on the outcome(s) it produces and NOT as an ideology in itself. We have too many double standards in our society these days. We should have enough wisdom to be consistent.  More significantly, the risk this episode brings is heightening the odds that Congress will edge closer to regulating or introducing new measures including even possible anti-trust legislation to stymie the monopolistic powers of the monsters of tech starting with Facebook. If Zuckerberg would be as smart as Google, they would just pay a paltry $30m to the Australian media and have the case shut instead of creating a worldwide sensation . A $30m is a drop in the ocean for these big giants.FB may be seen as winning this stoush with Australia for not backing down, when it has in actual fact loss in ways that could possible create new nightmares for the social media giant - risk of user boycotts and/or increasing US regulatory risks.And yes, US regulation and anti-trust legislation is one of the key risks I identified months ago as being capable of bringing an end to the current US market rally.Remember the Monsters of Tech holds the key to where and how the key indices move.Washington: Facebook’s decision to ban Australians from sharing news stories is an unacceptable bullying tactic that demonstrates why governments around the world are cracking down on big tech, one the most senior Democrats in the US Senate says.Facebook’s dramatic move has attracted the attention of American politicians and featured on the front page of top-selling tabloid the New York Post.Mark Warner, the vice-chairman of the Democratic Senate caucus, said Australia was one of many countries, including the US, grappling with the market dominance of Google and Facebook and trying to craft regulatory solutions to the very real power these firms possess.Democratic Senator Mark Warner says social media giants such as Facebook have abused their market power. CREDIT:BLOOMBERGIt’s worrisome that large tech companies – which routinely tell policymakers they acknowledge the need for regulation – continually resort to using their large scale and dominance to undermine democratically-adopted laws, Warner told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.We have seen this again and again and it’s an unacceptable bullying tactic that only underscores concerns with their market dominance.Warner, who previously served as governor of Virginia, recently became chair of the powerful Senate intelligence committee.Earlier this month he introduced legislation that would overhaul internet regulations by making social media companies legally liable for harassment, scamming and hate speech posted on their platforms.The New York Post, one of the biggest-selling newspapers in the US, devoted its entire front page to Facebook’s Australia news ban on Friday, US time.The News Corp tabloid showed a map of Australia emblazoned with the word censored. A subheading described a worldwide call to boycott Facebook as it tightens control of what we see.When Facebook announced its decision to bar Australians from sharing news articles, Democratic congressman David Cicilline tweeted: If it is not already clear, Facebook is not compatible with democracy.Threatening to bring an entire country to its knees to agree to Facebook’s terms is the ultimate admission of monopoly power.Cicilline is chair of the House of Representatives’ anti-trust subcommittee which is examining steps to curtail the market power of tech giants such as Google and Facebook.British politicians from both the Conservative and Labour parties have urged the Morrison government to push ahead with its media bargaining code, which would compel social media companies to pay Australian media organisations tens of millions of dollars for the news content shared on their sites.Both Republicans and Democrats in the US Congress have grown increasingly critical of the power wielded by social media companies in recent years although they have strong disagreements about how to respond in terms of policy.Warner is one of several senators who have proposed amendments to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - a law that gives social media companies legal immunity for content posted on their platforms.He said the law had provided a get out of jail free card to social media companies for too long and that it was time to hold the firms accountable for the harmful, often criminal behaviour enabled by their platforms to which they have turned a blind eye for too long.President Joe Biden has called for Section 230 to be revoked, a rare point of agreement with predecessor Donald Trump.Trump called for the protections to be scrapped when Twitter started applying fact checks to his tweets.",51189815

(52wk) $4.8m 12 month price range $0.145 - $4.51 *Includes assumption of full share purchase plan subscription Price PerformanceInitial testing of three significant AEM anomalies to start soon CHN has been granted the long-awaited approval to access the Julimar State Forest areas of its large, 100% owned Julimar Platinum Group Elements-Nickel-Copper (PGE-Ni-Cu) Project located about 70km north-east of Perth, WA. We always expected the company would be able to get the necessary State Government approval, which has come from the Minister for the Environment in WA. CHN’s access to the Julimar State Forest on its granted Exploration Licence E70/5119 comes under the approved Stage 1 Conservation Management Plan (CMP), which enables the company to begin non-ground disturbing exploration.This will initially target the three significant airborne electromagnetic (AEM) anomalies identified in September 2020 over a distance of about 26km extending to the north from the Gonneville Intrusion, where the company has discovered very significant, shallow, world-scale PGE-Ni-Cu mineralisation.Any targets generated from the initial phase of exploration will be drill tested, subject to a second stage of CMP approval. PGE-Ni-Cu mineralisation could be more extensive than AEMs The approved exploration activities, which will have negligible impact on vegetation, fauna or recreational activities within the area, will be governed by the approved CMP and are initially planned to comprise prospect-scale soil geochemical sampling in conjunction with moving loop electromagnetic (MLEM) and ground gravity surveys centred over the Hartog, Baudin and Jansz AEM anomalies. This will be followed by infill soil geochemical sampling and MLEM to define targets for drill testing. This initial phase of exploration is anticipated to be completed in Q1 2021.CHN has identified very significant Ni-Cu-PGE mineralisation in drilling at Gonneville that is not obviously associated with magnetic or EM anomalism, so that situation could prevail around and away from the three AEM anomalies it is about to start testing. . Market reaction to access approval seems overdone The approval for initial non-ground disturbing activities in the State Forest, paving the way for CHN to conduct what is believed to be the first ever Ni-Cu-PGE exploration activities in that area is welcome and reduces uncertainty. Approval was always expected and now allows CHN to do basic, early stage exploration, so we think the market’s positive reaction (CHN is up ~17% since last week’s price) to it is overdone.Investment thesis: Spec. Buy, Val. $5.60/sh Six drilling rigs continue at Gonneville as the company carries out its 70,000m drilling program to define an open pittable Maiden Resource by mid-2021, which will have a significant Indicated Resource component to support detailed economic studies, and for reconnaissance exploration. CHN is very well funded to continue its major exploration program at Julimar plus drilling programs at the Pyramid Hill Gold Project in Victoria and limited exploration on its other projects with cash currently estimated at ~$120m (excluding the assumed proceeds of the current $10m share purchase plan (SPP)). This funding will support even higher levels of drilling activity and associated economic studies at Julimar. We continue to regard the Julimar Project as a world ranking one with potential to become a major new Tier-1 source of PGEs. We have updated our valuation for the recent capital raisings and Julimar access approval. Our valuation is lifted by 5% to $5.60/sh. Our Speculative Buy recommendation is retained.",50358067
6.6458412e+17,1ronnie,Its Over,"One way of determining if a stock has become overvalued is to conduct a peer comparison. In recent days, we have seen some hefty volatility in the trading of VUL shares which may be attributable to market participants being wary and concern if the stock price is justified.Below I have compared VUL against LTR which is another solid lithium prospect. Comparison on equal footing is never easy, while LTR has much larger lithium deposits than VUL, VUL has three larger advantages, being the only zero carbon lithium producer to be in the world and secondly having its lithium deposits strategically located in the vicinity of the EV plants in Europe and finally VUL will emerge as a notable renewable geothermal energy player in the process. Based on recent PFS completed by both companies, VUL has 3x the NPV of LTR and is scheduled for production slightly ahead of LTR. Yet at todays closing price of $8, VUL trades at a discount to LTR in market cap. Based on the attributes of VUL project which I reckon is superior to LTR and hence should expect VUL lithium pricing to command a higher premium, we should expect VUL market cap to be higher than LTR. For VUL market cap to align with that of LTR , i.e $800m, VUL ought to be valued at $9.30 in equal parity to LTR.Column 1Column 2Column 3Column 4Column 5Column 60PEER COMPARISONCODEMarket Cap (mil)PFS NPV Post-Tax (Bil)  AUDProductionLocation1VULCAN ENERGYVUL6853.542024Europe2LIONTOWN RESOURCESLTR7961.122025Australia Obviously VUL share price would be dictated by the vagaries of short term trade direction in the coming days, but the above benchmark along with Francis Wedins interview below provides me the confidence that we should see its valuation return to circa $9+ region. Personally, IMO for the potential VUL demonstrates in both strategically located zero carbon lithium and its renewable geothermal energy , anything at A$1B valuation (circa $11.70) is worthy of consideration. In the months ahead, we can only expect its sp to progressively head higher from there as we get more newsflow on its business progress and/or continue its upward trajectory in keeping with the rising trajectory of all lithium stocks. It is also at a level of market cap that instos can consider investing and in due time stock analysts would be providing coverage of the stock and ESG funds would most likely be participating at that point.Therefore, market participants who had bought at much higher prices in the past days should take heart that VUL business is very promising - it is at the right place at the right time with the right resource that is needed and this one is well poised to be a multi-billion dollar business in the year(s) ahead. Market participants who have yet to invest in Australias most promising renewable energy project of the coming future should consider and take the opportunity to participate should its sp come under selling pressure tomorrow.

The Austrian prospects containing indications of high-grade lithium targets with significant residual brownfields plus greenfields exploration potential across the entire 64 km2 project area. The Company’s Weinebene project is immediately adjacent to European Lithium’s (ASX: EUR) Wolfsberg deposit, where the Company postulates that the veins which comprise the JORC compliant 10.98MT @ 1.00% Li2O resource at the Wolfsberg deposit3 , strike into the Jadar´s Weinebene project area. The Company also has identified several prospect areas withing its Eastern Alps projects that require follow up evaluation and drill testing.The initial reconnaissance and rock sampling within the eastern Alps, defined numerous outcropping highgrade multiple spodumene-bearing pegmatite veins with the average value over the 70 samples being 1.61% Li2O and highest value 3.39% Li2O. There has been no modern and systematic lithium exploration on outcropping pegmatite (refer ASX Announcement 19 February 2019).Initial Soil Sampling Work Done on Weinebene Project Area 3 EUR ASX announcement 3 July 2017 - Resource Increase at WolfsbergThe lithium deposits of the type being explored in Austria are typically found in the form of spodumenebearing pegmatite vein-type deposits hosted by Paleozoic metamorphic formations predominantly mica schist, amphibolite and marbles. The pegmatites withing the Eastern Alps are related to crustal melting (anatexis) chemistry and that lithium enriched fluids are formed during high-grade regional metamorphism (higher amphibolite to lower eclogite facies). Spodumene mineralisation occurs in the form of a fine to coarse-grained mineralisation associated with quartz, feldspar and muscovite.In addition JDR has also added a silver mine to its portfolioJadar Resources (ASX:JDR) could add to its diversified metals portfolio through the acquisition of a mothballed Queensland silver mine from defunct Moreton Resources’ (ASX:MRV) which ostensibly comes with 20Moz of contained silver.Moreton’s Granite Belt tenement portfolio comprises five exploration tenements, one mining lease, and an in-situ crushing, screening, stacking and refining facility in the Silver Spur Basin in Southern Queensland.Included in the tenements is the Granite Belt silver project which contains an estimated total JORC mineral resource of 12.1 million tonnes at 53 grams per tonne silver for 20.3 million ounces of contained silver.The Granite Belt tenement is located three hours south-west of Brisbane, in southeast Queensland, in a region called Texas-Stanthorpe.Historic silver mining areaThe area hosted mining from the 1890s, the most significant of which was the Silver Spur mine which produced 100,000 tonnes at 800 grams per tonne silver, 25 per cent zinc, and 13 per cent lead.The Granite Belt silver mining operations of Moreton Resources are currently on care and maintenance, but have all relevant permits, equipment and inventory.Three copper and silver exploration targets – Hornet, Harrier and Hawker – are also in the package of tenements for copper and silver.All of the assets will transfer to Jadar once it has completed due diligence for the deal.Jadar also holds the Yanamina gold project in Peru that has a maiden JORC resource estimate of 6.7 million tonnes at 1.2 grams per tonne gold, and 4.31 grams per tonne silver for 265,987 ounces of gold and 934,500 oz of silver.",50330716

6.6724446e+17,gus66,Day traders weekend lounge February 19 - 21,"Originally posted by Patterns: ↑@CariKaya I think it is rule one that is creating the problems. My rule one is take volume off all charts. The problem is you want hard crisp entries that are repeatable on every trade and that get you in before volume kicks up. Waiting for volume to kick in makes people miss the most valuable bit of the trade. Entries should be a hard, well defined rules like a pullback to the top green line of a demand demand level, the exact point where a 3ema crosses above an 8ema, a change from a red Heiken Ashi candle to a the first green Heiken Ashi candle, a green candle forming on a pullback to a lower trendline, a green candle forming on a pullback to a major moving average, a push above the 50sma for rounded bottom breakouts etc. Price is king, volume is irrelevant to trade entry points. Trade price and take major distractions such as volume off the charts for the very good reason that they make people miss the best available entry and it is this that makes people buy high and sell low. Buy lower and get a more hard less subjective entry criterion and one that does not involve volume is the best thing any trader relying on volume as an entry criterion can do for their own personal wealth creation. The main rule of entries is to buy pullbacks to some predetermined hard line or mathematically derived point which represents value to the buyer. Volume is put on every chart by my chart provider and I methodically delete it from every chart for the very good reason that I do not want to wait for volume, I do not want to wait for confirmation that all the others I am competing with have already bought in. The trader who makes the most money is usually the one who buys methodically at the optimum buying price. The trader who makes least money would be the trader waiting for volume to give an entry signal while all the traders colleagues are already in the trade.Part of the discipline of trading is not to get caught up in iffy entries and nothing is more iffy than using volume instead of price to determine entry points. It is far better to work out the price you want to enter at mathematically from fundamentals than to enter because some clown with deep pockets but no idea of value sent price up by buying a truckload of shares at a ridiculous price but creating volume in doing so.. The rolled gold standard is to buy at the top of demand levels and the reason people will not/ or can not do that is because it often means buying in a downtrend faced by massive red candles. By the time traders wait for volume, wait for the second coming coming of Jesus Christ or wait for some other form of confirmation the best entry point is lost and therefore they revert to buying high which leaves them with nowhere to go. Nobody ever got trapped in a share by buying at the top of a demand level with a stop at the bottom of the demand level. Volume should not even be a serious consideration.Toughen up the entry point is the best option for any trader to improve trading and waiting for volume is just inviting subjectivity into the decision which has no place in successful trading.There are three major reasons people buy high. One is that they have no idea of how to draw a demand level and two is they do not have the fortitude or discipline to buy at that level. Three is that they have been sucked into believing that waiting for volume is some sort of help to their trading when it clearly never has been and never will be.Expand@Patterns thanks so much for this response. I mentioned you in a post on Friday while trading IP1. There wasnt a lot of volume.I had previously thought that you were using 5/9 ema/MA crosses on your intraday charts but your post suggests 3/8. I watched an interesting video a couple of months ago about the 3/8 cross and I was using that on Friday on my intraday chart to pick entry and exit. It worked really well. I wanted to check whether I had just jagged it so I watched a third entry without trading it and it too would have worked perfectly. Each trade I left a pip on the table as a safety It was my most successful day, not in dollar terms but in accuracy.

If you arent good at day trading (remember very few actually consistently profit from DT!) why try & force yourself to it! I cant imagine people here think DT is the only way to earn bucks in the stock market, is it? Not to demean DTers but point me towards just 1 DTer from around the world who has made it to the top 500 richest Forbes list??? I dont think you have one however you will find many MT/ LT investors in that elite global richest list - think about it!2. When you identify a position & enter early, let me give my personal ex. for ease of simplicity...I entered PUR at 1.9c not long ago (around 3 months ago) with $5000 and it just touched 6c+ = almost $18000 in 3 months just from PUR...BUT most importantly I did that without having to look at my screen every sec, without the fear of stock tracing back without getting my BP up or my eyes strained (migraines, headaches common in the DT space). Thats just PUR example, I have similar low entries in many such as VR1, VRX, EMN, LCL, SYA, EGR, RAN, QPM & all of these have bhagged from my entry...not boasting but just trying to add perspective that DT is NOT the only way to earn in the market. More importantly, for me personally I dont want to put my health on the line just for earning an income & DT believe me is quite stressful (BP & Hearth indicators can go up & eye sores/ migraines very common). I research go in low in some of the best companies out there & just hold them thru...doesnt matter market corrects, dips, stocks corrects or dips or whatever, if they are good they ALL eventually go back up as long as you arent in the high volatile sectors such as gold etc.One last point before I sign-off, I was surprised that experienced traders like @rick64 were influenced by the pump and bought PUR at 5.3 when the base clearly was at 3c based on that I can imagine what these pumps must have done to most newbies and some experienced DTers out here, which is sad.You only have ONE FAMILY whereas you can have many jobs and many stocks where if you loose one you can always enter other or re-enter the same but we only have one family, once they are gone they may never come back - set your priorities absolutely right folks!!!Just my 2 cents and a different perspective to those who are struggling to DT and stressing out in their lives which may affect their family lives too...as V pointed out life & family is much more beautiful and precious than stressing out and forcing on things that arent working out, try some alternates if you like.Hope my rather long post has helped a bit in putting things in perspective for some!Expandyep DTsSTsLTstradesride same and other just take income as they move.Some DT mentioned me does not touch, but watch em for a possible ST later, when they go down and wait for the next ridelow volume swingers (got to get to know em) are the ones me likes, sometimes DTs but mostly STs week or twoThanks ya awl for some insightful postsreminds me of another time in the DTers AMremember HC goes in cycles, just like stocksand the number 23rd rule is:Two type of Trades:#: Income is income (not a win)#: Cost is COst (not a loss)get the emotion levels at a business level",51189298

But let me tell you, If you look at certain stock threads where such posters have provided great analysis and sounded convincing through their research, let me tell you that it did not end well for most of their followers... Many people lost alot of money, particularly in stocks like CXZ (just one example) ...There are some pretty sad true stories of people who lost everything which should serve as a reminder to never play with money you cant afford to lose, and to do YOUR OWN research ... Just because some poster has a hotcopper love heart (and an amazing record of picking multiple 300-500% stocks) and 20k Upvotes, it doesnt mean their research is accurate and your money is safe!!

In stock threads, most posters talk up there own stock & make it sound like a good thing and this can mess with your head a littleWhether it be on this thread, the DT morning and afternoon thread, or in stock threads, be careful whose advice you follow.... Dont just look at number of posts and likes and upvotes etc... VERY DANGEROUS....I have been here almost a year, and I can count on my fingers the number of people I trust ...

Please read that PDF I posted, and in particular, I suggest soaking in stuff said by people such as Elite Trader, Slick, Juliarr and our dearly beloved V These are NO BS posters and wonderul human beings who have been dearly blessed by the Market Gods and on occasion are willing to share / guide us newbies Expandwhatever anyone tells you from here is just an opinion. No one can see the future, not even people that right media articles and perform analysis.You could have the best idea and plenty of money and still fail. Many businesses do every year. The difference is execution. A business plan executed well via the appropriate distribution of capital is the difference. Were seeing some exceptional execution by management up to now.You raise concerns over competitors and I dont believe that is going to be a problem. I believe there will be plenty of competitors both existing and new. I would say this; how many BNPL companys are listed on the ASX? Now how many of those reported record growth? I believe they all did?How does that happen???Well, look at traditional in store shopping. Its declined pretty heavily significantly because of Covid-19. This has forced a drastic shift in the way businesses of all kinds have had to serve their customers. In other words, in store shopping dropped off and e-commerce increased. This is a real inflection point for finance as it is enhanced by technology or more commonly known as fintech. In the history of business the biggest companys have become what they are by riding these inflection points and pioneering change.Now IOU are not the pioneers of BNPL and as you mentioned there are other players such as Grab, Razor Fintech, Hoolah, Rely, etc. I believe the difference in approach is what separates IOU from the competitors. While the competitors focus on the credit card holders IOU is pulling together data from financial and non-financial institutions like Telcos (everyone has a phone because its a part of life). This unbanked/under banked portion of the population is exceedingly large. This is done through the sophisticated e-KYC module that IOU have developed for onboarding not only consumers but also merchants and gateways. Thats right, they have an onboarding feature for gateways as well.IOU as a company has operated with the top 20 banks and telcos for the past 20 years. This is a business that is deeply ingrained into the Malaysian economy. IOU doesnt need to have the entire pie to be successful. The entire SE Asian region is anticipated to be worth $300b by 2024. Even a .001% piece of the pie is worth $300m in revenue. Multiply that by the average price to sales ratio for BNPL which 20 and you get a whopping $6b market cap or $10.90 per share (550m shares). Thats still a big ask but decrease the percentage of market share to whatever you feel comfortable with and it becomes pretty clear that the company value has a better chance of increasing than decreasing based on what we have seen up until now.This of course is my opinion and I cant give you the answer about how much the company will be worth or when it will be worth that amount but I can say its already taken us all for a pretty nice ride, its up to you when you want to get off.Now this guy is one I like.

They don’t need to change the processing. They are constrained by the size of the plant. This is one of the challenges in making the north dune viable.Kuranze is where they are most excited. They think it could be the source of rutile at Kwale.Supercycle question. They cant guess on that but production is constrained with nothing much on the horizon for the next 2 years. So they do see solid prices into the future as demand grows.They are not about consistency of dividends but about distributing cash that is surplus to their needs to advance the project at Toliara and they will hold back on that when its relevant so they can have more equity in Toliara. $350 mill usd debt , JV opportunity, off take arrangements, cashflow from Kwale from to fund during construction.Scalability in Toliara, upsize potential based on where the market is going. JV that comes with an offtake has an advantage that it can underwrite an earlier increase in scale because of the way it breaks the back of the marketing effort. Tim is pretty excited about this as a feature of this project.They weren’t driven by optimizing NPV in determining the size of the project in the BFS perspective. At the time it was based on the amount of product that could be sensibly put into the market. Their view on that has changed and they believe that they can make it bigger. Dividends… want to be a stable dividend payer but they have a lumpy opportunity in front of them. They think its best to hold back cash once that’s clear to invest it in holding on to more of the Toliara project. That’s clearly in the best interest of shareholders.",51239475

6.673917e+17,TerribleTadpole,Bitcoin Vs Gold (Analog Vs Digital),"I used to mine bitcoins a few years ago, and traded on an exchange to leverage the coins I made mining. Lost the lot in the Mt Gox raid! As I see it there are significant issues with Bitcoin that dont apply to physical assets or currency:The ledger is already so large and unwieldy that it places an enormous burden or heavy constraints on on new adopters. You either have to wait days and use gigabytes of bandwidth to synch a new wallet, or sacrifice a significant level of security and use a hosted wallet.The founder completely failed to anticipate the level of technological innovation that Bitcoin would generate in terms of sophisticated, dedicated computing power devoted to Bitcoin mining. The energy consumed and emissions produced are disproportionate and impossible to control or regulate. The original concept of bitcoin mining was that anybody could contribute, and the large numbers of participants would help to protect the integrity of the blockchain. But with the capital and operating costs of ASICs blockchain integrity is in the hands of relatively few large operators. Thats a risk.Only a cold wallet is truly secure. But you cant spend your Bitcoins and keep your wallet cold. The moment you bring a wallet online you are exposed to attack so the only way to keep your funds safe is to transfer your balance immediately to a new cold wallet. That makes managing your Bitcoins very inconvenient and cumbersome.There is no facility in the Bitcoin protocol to replace lost Bitcoins. Every crashed hard drive, lost memory stick, cold wallet with lost credentials, and dead wallet owner results in irretrievably lost bitcoins. So in fact far from a fixed supply Bitcoin represents a diminishing supply of currency.I see these as significant barriers both to widespread adoption and long term continuation of Bitcoin.",51239388

Even if this analyst is correct regarding no snap back in daigou sales yet, it appears that they agree revenue and earnings would still be within range. However, I have one bone to pick with their broader assessment. They emphasised that A2 diversifying its channel mix is key which is true. However, they have barely said a word on the other channels, e.g. CBEC, MBS, suggesting that they do not have much in-depth insight into what is happening in these areas. What is going on in some of those channels can help to explain some of the daigou issues raised (e.g. perhaps brand spend is being allocated a bit differently across the channels now than it was pre-COVID).",51239377

I dont like being negative esp being a holder but now not so sure about the risk vs return here. Just thought Id mention it. For instance, here is a distribution map of all acid sulfate soil landfill locations in regional Vic. https://cleanaway2stor.blob.core.windows.net/cleanaway2-blob-container/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Acid-Sulfate-Soil-Fact-Sheet.pdfExpandPatty, Im not sure if you are attempting to mislead or you just dont understand the link you have posted?That is a map of acid sulphate distribution sites around Melbourne. In other words where there is naturally occurring acid sulphate soils. It is not a map of disposal sites.If you could post the actual disposal sites and the volume that they can take it would be appreciated. Are there any sites around Melbourne that can take 5 million tonnes of acid sulphate soils? Also you have not taken into account the cost of treatment and the landfill levy imposed by the government. NAG is definitely the best environmental and cost option. We should know in the next few weeks where the PASS will be going. For this reason I will be holding tightly to my shares.",51239371

6.6739164e+17,Kikker1959,ASX Today,"Originally posted by Scarpa ↑I guess valuations are based on what you assume is the development scenario. 1. In production share price is a function of nominal values relating to EPS, nominal profit and P/E ratios. LTR is not in production so valuations are not based on this currently IMO, so valuations are based on NPV values currently.2. Before production, and here we are talking before DFS/finance/FID, share price is a function of NPV as you look at risks and the opportunity cost of capital from a valuation perspective. In production you go back to 1 above so the downsttream processing options will have higher nominal EPS numbers btw and therefore higher SP on the assumption DFS outcomes are met.3. The time value of money a key, and that is the point. So many here look at LTR as if they are in production and the capex has been installed . Important for TO talk, because anyone taking over LTR will have a TO price discounted for the NPV value of capex and based on a discounted cash flow. I posted about this a while ago and the theory of valuation and TO is here - Post #:​44658142​ - and obviously is an old post.4. NPV/Profit below comes from - 1st two columns Ann 9/10/2020 - last 2 columns 22/10/2020. In terms of 1st two columns assuming start up as spodumene operation as per that Ann to achieve the anticipated production start date. Given hydroxide/sulphate still at scoping study this is what is added on later - if this is the configuration one starts with then valuations adjust upwards in production.So what is a fair value as of today - answer really depends on what the market is looking at.Personally I suspect the market is assuming an upgraded NPV based on a spodumene operation with possibly the added hydroxide/sulphate plant. If it is only looking at the Ann without a hydroxide/sulphate plant then current SP is been influenced a lot more by Moora than some think here, in my opinion. If it is incorporating a hydroxide/sulphate proposal current SP less so influenced by Moora. The next major leg up here on the lithium project is the DFS, followed by offtakes and funding (assuming as TG says he is taking this to mining). Obviously Moora is the current SP trigger IMO given the table above.Do your own scenarios - that is how the valuation would have been done. As I said too many here are doing valuations as if LTR is in production, given where it is currently at. Meaning, current valuations is currently based on SP been a function of NPV. This was a quick guide - enter your own numbers of anticipated shares on issue etc.In terms of the Moora Ann, it will be interesting given that Ann did not have a number of signatures associated with PGEs, albeit it is likely that if they exist - the mafics/ultramafics, they will be deeper given the drilling wasnt deep in that initial drilling program anyway. So agree with many here the two deeper RC holes are going to be the key to understanding the geology in that drilled area.

Given that this hasnt happened is a questionabe reflection on the Board and, the fiduciary responsibility on the Board to advise shareholders what the obstacles are and how those obstacles are planned to be resolved.Id like to think AUZ is in advanced stages of finalising an off-take partner. I understand the finer details are painstakingly sensitive and time consuming, but at the same time sufficient time has lapsed for those finer details to have been addressed.For such a large project (AUD in excess of a billion dollars) I always thought AUZ would chase/seek mutliple off-takers but in their more recent announcements, the indication is for a sole off-take partner. This being the case, the sole off-take partner would need to be a widely recognised party so that the funder(s) can get comfortabe with the financial strength of the off-taker, that it would be able to purchase the materials from AUZ with ease (no defaults). AUZ will need to show that its cash-flow will be robust and dependable from the funder(s) point of view, so that this mega project can be suitably funded.I think shareholders should approach AUZ to be more transparent so that we can better understand the situation. Just like AUZ has strategies so do shareholders and, more transparent communication is necessary between partners.ExpandI’ll answer that question for you.non disclosure.let’s call Auz ring ringauz: good morning can I help yoush: yes why do we not have a offtake, you need to be more transparentauz: yes sir, as I’m sure you understand these negotiations are underway and under strict non disclosure laws.

Ive been reading about that new electrical transmission line to Mt Isa and other areas in the Nth West named CopperString 2.0 project. https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/91360Would it be a possible as an option for the area rehabilitation to become a solar farm which would connect to that new line and therefore the Australias Power Grid. On google maps the area is flat and huge. Along with a high amount of sun all year around, sunrise to sunset with minimal hills. As @@miningnut said that $4 million hedge seems a waste of money along with $ spent on Goro. Why not spend a small small amount on a feasibility study to see if a solar farm is possible. There are most likely government grants to pay for this. Note: ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY.In a low interest rate environment, along with helicopter money from all levels of government and carbon credits to present the mines green credentials along with the media hype around this and a future hedge for NCZ not just to mine zinc and silver but to also potentially become a player in the clean energy future and be classed as an ESG company. Which is all the rage these days. And lets not forget jobs, jobs and more jobs in a potential election year. Even the federal government will contribute to workers wages with Job Marker.Im pretty sure that someone from NCZ high up follows this thread, or its their job to write fluffy things about NCZ which is fine as every company does it.

Boab Could be at the front of line for this hungry investment money -- Boab certainly seems the most lilely to go to mine and in the short term just waiting on funding and offtake which will likely happen after the upgraded DFS. So why is Boab Lagging its peers and in a short term bear market analytically, what could be causing this lack of demand over supply for the stock (other than digital rebranding shocking).Do you think other than us handful of hotcopper investors and the registrar of long termers that anyone has discovered Boab Yet? Like all trees, Is our Boab grown from seed and still at that precarious time where an insect or gust of wind can destroy it.I spoke of the unintended conseqences of a name change in the digital era. I think its really obvious now that at open we have no buyers and this has been a trend for a couple of weeks. It signals no new investors. We have some that know of the stock buying in but mainly this is very stale and would have been an obvious short knowing this would completely vanish off screens until the word finally gets out. We kicked an own goal with the digital mistake, it will take a long time to resolve (usually i get paid to consult Boards / Owners to NOT mess with branding --- unfortunatley for me here i am a shareholder so the mistakes have hit me far worse financially than milking a wage and taking a hit to the confidence).Times i dont want vindiction . If it aint broke, dont fix it. Hoping Boab get someone to fix digital side else organically i will take 6 months to a year to get back to where we were organically.I basically invest in 4 stocks (boab, firefinch, beacon and firstgraphene) -- all are a similar market cap.. all but boab are producing -- but my focus here is on the digital.. look how well theFire finch Twitter account and linkedin accounts are going.. they must be getting thousands of views per month and loads of click throughs.. this will be from a perfect targeted group of likely cashed up investors looking for a stock to load up on.Look at First Graphene linkedin and twitter account.... same thing.. free channels getting heaps of interaction and expsosure that take virtually no time to manage as its just posting announcments and the occassional mine / bussiness update with images. Both seem to value brand visibility and understand that a big part of selling the story is rich media including images and videos ... not nessesary but when you rebrand over christmas into the wall street silver shortage year of 2021 with reckless abandon to digital visibility i say lets not split hairs on why we are being trolled by the JP Morgan guy here.. nothing to do with project viability or peers being anything on the resource we have in the best juristiction in the world close to port. IMO it all comes down to what was poor digital execution and we are dealing with it in effect -- so as stated for those in the bubble its buy time, but without new investors finding us.. the SP will have amplified vunerability to the downside assumming we dont have a white Knight in our bubble this could easily get shorted successfully..A rising silver price will float all ships so i expect Boab to lag intially today but for value investors to step up when Boab is shown to be a laggard (as we have seen on up silver days, today will be no different). Many weak hands to exit here as it dosent pop to the upside vs peers in the coming weeks imo.

The proposed US listing, and push for increased trading in EU may, IMO, shed some light on how advanced off-take/customer negotiations have progressed. 2) It is unlikely that this push will be in isolation from a greatly improved marketing campaign. Further, this may be concomitant with a synergistic r/ship with AS and ecograf. I don’t think that Roly will just open shop in a new town without the requisite fanfare. As a result, the expected marketing push will have a ripple effect in existing and new retail investor markets; with great benefits to new Aus. investor recruitment.3) the knowledge, and embrace of the EU retail/insto catchment is well ahead of our Australian investment base. The average punter, generally, in EU has a much greater understanding of the significance of renewable energy than we do. Australian punters are at least many months to possibly years behind in there understanding of this global paradigm shift.

Graphite has long been used in the aviation, automotive, sports, steel and plastic industries, as well as in the manufacture of bearings and lubricants. Graphite is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity, is corrosion- and heat-resistant, and is strong and light.Graphite is indispensable to the shift towards Electric Vehicles (cars, trains, buses, bikes etc.). There is no substitute for graphite and is expected to remain the foundation of all lithium-ion EV battery chemistries for the foreseeable future. Graphite is the second-largest component of lithium batteries by weight, and they contain 10-15 times more graphite than lithium https://aheadoftheherd.com/americas-graphite-vulnerability-2/More than 5 billion people around the world currently have a mobile phone – all powered by lightweight batteries made using graphite with graphite foil for heat dispersion being an integral component. Every portable computer also uses graphite for batteries and graphite foil for heat dispersion.Future uses of Graphite include Flexible graphite sheets / Graphoil flexible graphite; Nuclear power having a higher melting point than steel, doesn’t burn until 3,000°C; Fuel cells; Solar thermal collectors; Vanadium redox batteries and off course…Graphene - dubbed the strongest material in the world, this thin, flexible commodity is 10 times lighter and 200 times stronger than steel. Due to its atomic structure, graphene can be moulded into any shape and conducts electricity at the speed of light.

Thanks for reminding me why the SP is not over $1.ExpandMate, its not over $1 because they havent started making money, you cant expect the share price to just keep going up and up. The company has to hit more milestones first. And I dont understand this negative tone her from people about the capital raise. It was great. It was at a good price and generated enough cash to roll out the next cluster without being in a desperate situation. Some of their other fund raising was terrible but had to be done because they had so little cash - they couldnt be picky and had to raise on some pretty bad terms. We are well positioned now for the future. Honestly so much of the KSS threads are just people relentlessly pumping and throwing out price targets with no analysis or logic, then others getting disappointed when these pie in the sky price targets are not met. $1 is very realistic, but well see the re-rate when the company has hit its milestones. Even at the current price, it had a significant re-rate compared to before the first satellite launch.

These differences can be semantically misleading - for instance, people reading that there are no more intangible assets to amortise may not realise that there may well be intangible assets, like goodwill that can, and will, be impaired.A trade name like Golding can only be impaired, rather than amortised. This means that if NWH ceases to use that name, it would write it off as an impairment, which would increase expenses when done, but not affect cash flow. Some shareholders may not realise this, and think real expenses have increased.",51238988

6.6739122e+17,Scarpa,ASX Today,"I guess valuations are based on what you assume is the development scenario. 1. In production share price is a function of nominal values relating to EPS, nominal profit and P/E ratios. LTR is not in production so valuations are not based on this currently IMO, so valuations are based on NPV values currently.2. Before production, and here we are talking before DFS/finance/FID, share price is a function of NPV as you look at risks and the opportunity cost of capital from a valuation perspective. In production you go back to 1 above so the downsttream processing options will have higher nominal EPS numbers btw and therefore higher SP on the assumption DFS outcomes are met.3. The time value of money a key, and that is the point. So many here look at LTR as if they are in production and the capex has been installed . Important for TO talk, because anyone taking over LTR will have a TO price discounted for the NPV value of capex and based on a discounted cash flow. I posted about this a while ago and the theory of valuation and TO is here - Post #:44658142 - and obviously is an old post.4. NPV/Profit below comes from - 1st two columns Ann 9/10/2020 - last 2 columns 22/10/2020. In terms of 1st two columns assuming start up as spodumene operation as per that Ann to achieve the anticipated production start date. Given hydroxide/sulphate still at scoping study this is what is added on later - if this is the configuration one starts with then valuations adjust upwards in production.So what is a fair value as of today - answer really depends on what the market is looking at.Personally I suspect the market is assuming an upgraded NPV based on a spodumene operation with possibly the added hydroxide/sulphate plant. If it is only looking at the Ann without a hydroxide/sulphate plant then current SP is been influenced a lot more by Moora than some think here, in my opinion. If it is incorporating a hydroxide/sulphate proposal current SP less so influenced by Moora. The next major leg up here on the lithium project is the DFS, followed by offtakes and funding (assuming as TG says he is taking this to mining). Obviously Moora is the current SP trigger IMO given the table above.Do your own scenarios - that is how the valuation would have been done. As I said too many here are doing valuations as if LTR is in production, given where it is currently at. Meaning, current valuations is currently based on SP been a function of NPV. This was a quick guide - enter your own numbers of anticipated shares on issue etc.In terms of the Moora Ann, it will be interesting given that Ann did not have a number of signatures associated with PGEs, albeit it is likely that if they exist - the mafics/ultramafics, they will be deeper given the drilling wasnt deep in that initial drilling program anyway. So agree with many here the two deeper RC holes are going to be the key to understanding the geology in that drilled area. Posted this in OAR around signatures - Bottom half - Post #:47672363 and then Post #:46741749Treat this post as you will - posted for interest sake as I like valuations.

6.673911e+17,Hot News,News: OSH UPDATE 1-Oil Search posts surprise underlying profit on cost-cutting,"(Adds background, detail on Pikka project, share movement) Feb 23 (Reuters) - Oil Search (OSH) on Tuesday posted a surprise annual core profit as the Papua New Guinea-focused oil and gas company aggressively cut costs to overcome a slump in prices and lower demand due to the pandemic. The oil price collapse forced the company to cut jobs, raise cash and write off the value of some exploration assets. While its key growth projects in PNG were held up by wrangling with the government, it focused on the development of its $3 billion Pikka oil project in Alaska. On Monday, Oil Search said it would begin engineering and design work for the Pikka project, which aims to start production in 2025 at 80,000 barrels per day. The PNG-focussed explorer said core net profit after tax for the year ended Dec. 31 fell to $22.0 million, from $320.9 million a year ago. Analysts were expecting the company to post a core loss of $24.7 million, according to Refinitiv IBES. Its shares were up as much as 5.4% to A$4.27, their biggest intraday gain since Jan. 13. On a statutory basis, Oil Search posted a net loss after tax of $320.7 million, compared with a profit of $312.4 million. Revenue declined 32% to $1.07 billion, even as the company reported strong annual production last month, while warning of lower output and challenging conditions in 2021. It declared a final dividend of 0.50 U.S. cent per share, down from 4.50 U.S. cents per share it paid last year.",51238775

Good luck to all holders.https://www.globaltimes-sl.com/cycl...a-leone-with-attractive-investment-proposals/BUSINESSCyclon Metals Plans To Enter Sierra Leone With Attractive Investment ProposalsByAmadu DaramyPublished on February 22, 2021The Global Times recently obtained insider information about the planned new mining act that has already triggered the first investment proposals by some credible foreign mining companies.According to documents obtained by the Global Times from various sources, the Government plans to revise the Mining Act, which has already led to changes in the investment strategy by some foreign investors.However, the new Mining Act may still be a subject to changes and will have to be ratified by the Parliament.Cyclon Metals Ltd, an Australian based mining developer and investment company listed on the stock exchange made according to government insiders an attractive investment proposal to the Government of Sierra Leone, proposing a total investment of several millions of US-Dollars and the creation of more than 500 new qualified jobs in its proposed Marampa Mining Joint Venture.Cyclon Metals Ltd. is the successor of Cape Lambert which several years ago explored the Marampa Iron Ore deposit and then later had a dispute with the government and was hit by Ebola and a depressed market.Cyclon Metals as a new investor with a broad range of mining assets plans to make use of the already fully explored Marampa South deposit in which Cape Lambert proved more than 600 Mio/t of high grade iron ore that can be mined in an economical and environmentally friendly manner.According to documents obtained by the Global Times, the initial investment phase for the proposal will include a USD50 Million equity investment offering the Government not only a free 10% stake as proposed by the draft mining act but also an additional 5% free interest as the investment steps up. A 15% free carried interest even exceeds the government interests in other ECOWAS countries.The main basis for the Cyclon Metal proposal is already the possibility to immediately start the mining process in 2021 on the basis of the full exploration already done by its successor Cyclon Metals.In addition, the country can expect a new phase of infrastructure development in the region that will include roads and in a later phase a railway access.The Government and Cyclon Metals declined to comment on this matter or could not be reached.It waits to be seen how the Government will react to the proposal and when the new Mining Act is approved by the Sierra Leonean Parliament.",51238751

And also my desire to have our SIZE holding in-specie pro-rata distributed to PGM shareholders and at same time an Aussie trading platform for such established.But not yet Maximus.The comedy of it all is is that at current relative prices the BEST way into SIZE is thru PGM .......... cos PGM share cap is basically valued at our shareholding in SIZE. Thats the way it seems. Withe similar tech target pct upside for theirs and our next wave breakouts. IT SEEMS as though if they move up x5 so will we. But they dont have all the other goodies which are effectively valued at ZILCH in their kitty viz Owendale, Munni Munni Challa etc. So am very happy to enter thru PGM at current prices on relativities,Later though would love to have a mill SIZE shares to play with as they inevitably ??? (IMO) head for a bill bucks MC at time of PFS over the next year or so ??? Well 2 bucks for starters I can see. And u can see by this presentation they know what they are doing and have a good plan to bring it all to the fore , and at much more significant state than what our 2013 Scoping Study did. So yeah no urgency now BUT reckon shareholders should have a really close look at what Skaergaard fair value is going to look like after 10-15,000m DD from June and at PFS time. Love the idea of a floating turnkey camp right next to the deposit per hiring a small ship haha, Brilliant !!!Hots u should be looking closely at this.

Dont know why I even bother to have any traders so long as the precious metals charts have uptrends intact. AAAAND LOVE the consideration of other goodies like Copper, Titanium, Vanadium and Gallium in the later drill cores to be used toward a more comprehensive ore resource / reserve, And that starter open pit possibility is interesting with a doable strip ratio when all things are taken into account, tho I see no reason why this cant go bulk underground mining with modern tech since it outcrops to a surface start and only slopes at 20 degrees.Going to be a most interesting year or ten for the Ice Queen and PGM hey, espesh if we return to the wild and rewarding of 70s style days as is looking more and more likely.Thank you Teddy A for spotting this.

I understand the finer details are painstakingly sensitive and time consuming, but at the same time sufficient time has lapsed for those finer details to have been addressed.For such a large project (AUD in excess of a billion dollars) I always thought AUZ would chase/seek mutliple off-takers but in their more recent announcements, the indication is for a sole off-take partner. This being the case, the sole off-take partner would need to be a widely recognised party so that the funder(s) can get comfortabe with the financial strength of the off-taker, that it would be able to purchase the materials from AUZ with ease (no defaults). AUZ will need to show that its cash-flow will be robust and dependable from the funder(s) point of view, so that this mega project can be suitably funded.I think shareholders should approach AUZ to be more transparent so that we can better understand the situation.

It is an environmentally friendly purification technology that avoids the use of any chlorine or hydrofluoric acid. Furthermore, its reported net price per unit cost is US$1,398/t (refer to ASX Release, July 1 2020, page 3) which is the lowest cost for producing PSG in the world.I hope that answers your question. Itll be nice to have you along for the ride. DYORExpandHi Mally,Always good to include ALL details.....which is the lowest cost for producing PSG in the world...By leveraging off the comparatively low-cost of Siviour Graphite Concentrates as feedstockfor PSG production, and co-locating the downstream operation in Australia, the BatteryAnode Material Study shows a globally competitive gross operating cost of US$1,989 pertonne of PSG.Renascor achieves a relatively low PSG unit operating cost in large part because the batteryanode materials operation obtains the key raw material, Graphite Concentrates, at Renascor’s operating cost, rather than the market price that would be charged by thirdparty suppliers.Accordingly, Renascor’s cost for obtaining Graphite Concentrates for downstreamprocessing into PSG is equal to Siviour’s projected life of mine unit operating cost of US$355per tonne.Thats just a nice reshuffling of the figures, so no profit from running the mine to chive a lower PSG costA some might know Caustic Roasting is not a bad process, but not the best and might present approval issues if tying to construct a 2nd plant in another country.",51238513

If anyone sees potential for this company to deliver over the course of the next 2 or so years then treating this as a term deposit with some higher risk but the possible higher return may be a better option. For me its in the bottom draw and that equates to a term deposit. Bots will have trouble with accessing the bottom draw as theyre fundamentally flawed.

6.6739044e+17,Slare,Media Updates,"Stephen Ridgewell published and extensive preview overnight in advance of the ATM 1H21 result on Thursday. The result is pre-guided with $181m of EBITDA expected although the key questions for Ridgewell is whether ATM can provide confidence that revenue and margin trends are stabilising sequentially and also whether ATM can diversify its channels to market and defend its brand premium under new CEO David Bortolussi. Clarity on the latter question will take some time, although feedback from our proprietary large daigou contacts suggest that the sequential sales snap back is yet to eventuate. The issues around this important channel are multifaceted but can be best summarised as follows:· Volumes declining - volume trends have worsened in early 2021 with Jan sales -70% yoy (vs. -55% yoy in the Dec qtr) with a much smaller than normal increase in demand ahead of the Chinese New Year period (chart 1)· ATM’s daigou market share has eased – ATM has gone from market share gainer in 2018/19 to holding relative share versus other key daigou brands such as Danone’s Aptamil.· Eroding Price Premiums – The decline in ATM’s price point benchmarked to 1 January 2020 has been more severe than other major brands which could reflect inventory overstocking but also greater A2 only competition (see Feihe’s A2 launch below).· Price cuts have struggled to trickle down – ATM alluded to some prices cuts to restore daigou margins although feedback suggests that these have not yet been passed on from wholesale to large daigou.· Brand spend needs to increase – Feedback suggests that ATM has become much harder to sell with daigou commenting that in addition to price cuts they want ATM to increase brand spend.ATM’s current challenges reflect a mix of industry headwinds but also ATM specific issues. International brand market share has fallen from 56% to 49% over the past two years, driven by i) food safety concerns with consumers concerned about the risk of catching COVID from imported tins ii) regulations that support domestic brands iii) greater nationalism and iv) increasing competition as domestic brands more aggressively target tier 1 & 2 cities. This however does not explain why ATM’s history of gaining share appears to have halted. Whatever the primary driver, as Ridgewell indicates, ATM’s over-reliance on the daigou channel also means it has been more impacted by its collapse. With this in mind we now expect ATM to deliver FY21e EBITDA of $387m, at the low end of the guidance range ($364m - $450m, midpoint $406m) and with the PER still elevated at 31x we prefer to sit on the side-lines at these levels. Neutral rating retained with an updated TP -9% to $10.63 …",51238163

There are smaller amounts to add on, mining village rental, head office costs and so on but these can’t possibly be more than $4 per tonne ($4 million per the million tonnes being mined). So to my reckoning our costs are no more than $85AUS per tonne. A IO price of $110-120AUS gives a healthy profit after Pilbara take their 30%.

6.6739032e+17,zebster,POS vs WSA Valuation Comparison,"Originally posted by sydneysider: ↑Fast tracking the time line. IMHO the timeline published in the new presentation is already being fast tracked. Diamond drilling of Peppermint Grove is stated to start in April, six weeks from now BUT we have already completed the first DD (my guesstimate) from the Silver Swan workings into the high grade nickel zone. Assuming we drill an average of 50 meters a day POS will have completed an additional +3 holes (each 700 meters or more) before we hit the start date in the formal timeline. THEN we add two drills to cover 400 -500 meters across the entire Southern Terrace. So we get 10 -20 holes x 500m = 5,000 -10,000 meters ( 2 drills 50 meters per day for 100 meters) completed in 50 - 100 days PLUS 2,500 - 5,000 meters from Silver Swan workings for an extra 3-6 holes (at +700 meters). THEN we might discover that the Drill Decline is completed 1-2 weeks ahead of schedule? IMHO we are headed to 10-15 cents (at least) a share over next 2-3 months. Spectacular results will put us into a moonshot phase. Loaded up with more shares last week at 7.3 cents. Good luck to all longs. ExpandThe timeline shown in the preso is intact and not running ahead of schedule. Youre confusing ST exploration drilling (underway now with the first hole - not yet completed and not shown in the preso timeline) wth GS maiden resource drilling (shown in the preso), which is due to commence in early-April once the Drill Drive (the real DD) is completed.",51237998

6.6739002e+17,acmecomp,WSB/potentIal PM sQuEEze,"Originally posted by 1for1: ↑Morning Botswana Metals Hodlers.Metals prices are Astro (Silver, Lead, Zinc) and demand for commodities stocks and exposure to upside from 10 years bull market as preidcted by many Economics analysts. Boab Could be at the front of line for this hungry investment money -- Boab certainly seems the most lilely to go to mine and in the short term just waiting on funding and offtake which will likely happen after the upgraded DFS. So why is Boab Lagging its peers and in a short term bear market analytically, what could be causing this lack of demand over supply for the stock (other than digital rebranding shocking).Do you think other than us handful of hotcopper investors and the registrar of long termers that anyone has discovered Boab Yet? Like all trees, Is our Boab grown from seed and still at that precarious time where an insect or gust of wind can destroy it.I spoke of the unintended conseqences of a name change in the digital era. I think its really obvious now that at open we have no buyers and this has been a trend for a couple of weeks. It signals no new investors. We have some that know of the stock buying in but mainly this is very stale and would have been an obvious short knowing this would completely vanish off screens until the word finally gets out. We kicked an own goal with the digital mistake, it will take a long time to resolve (usually i get paid to consult Boards / Owners to NOT mess with branding --- unfortunatley for me here i am a shareholder so the mistakes have hit me far worse financially than milking a wage and taking a hit to the confidence).Times i dont want vindiction . If it aint broke, dont fix it. Hoping Boab get someone to fix digital side else organically i will take 6 months to a year to get back to where we were organically.I basically invest in 4 stocks (boab, firefinch, beacon and firstgraphene) -- all are a similar market cap.. all but boab are producing -- but my focus here is on the digital.. look how well theFire finch Twitter account and linkedin accounts are going.. they must be getting thousands of views per month and loads of click throughs.. this will be from a perfect targeted group of likely cashed up investors looking for a stock to load up on.Look at First Graphene linkedin and twitter account.... same thing.. free channels getting heaps of interaction and expsosure that take virtually no time to manage as its just posting announcments and the occassional mine / bussiness update with images. Both seem to value brand visibility and understand that a big part of selling the story is rich media including images and videos ... not nessesary but when you rebrand over christmas into the wall street silver shortage year of 2021 with reckless abandon to digital visibility i say lets not split hairs on why we are being trolled by the JP Morgan guy here.. nothing to do with project viability or peers being anything on the resource we have in the best juristiction in the world close to port. IMO it all comes down to what was poor digital execution and we are dealing with it in effect -- so as stated for those in the bubble its buy time, but without new investors finding us.. the SP will have amplified vunerability to the downside assumming we dont have a white Knight in our bubble this could easily get shorted successfully..A rising silver price will float all ships so i expect Boab to lag intially today but for value investors to step up when Boab is shown to be a laggard (as we have seen on up silver days, today will be no different). Many weak hands to exit here as it dosent pop to the upside vs peers in the coming weeks imo. I will continue to hold but will try to refrain from posting here as i have been.Expandi agree as you can see the divergence of silver / BML correspond to the new Company naming and the consolidation. I said at the time i thought it was a mistake and still stand by that.",51237737

6.6738996e+17,SoConfused,Bitcoin Vs Gold (Analog Vs Digital),"Originally posted by DoctorFouad: ↑Gold vs Bitcoin?Its no contest, physical vs virtual. Just the intrinsic nature of both assets implies the answer.Gold stood the test of time as a store of value for more than 5000 years. Two ounces of gold 2500bc in pharaonic egypt would buy you a cow. Skip 4500 years forward (today) two ounces of gold (1800$ * 2= 3600$) would still buy you a cow! Isnt that amazing?Beyond scarcity, there are many reasons why gold is the second best anti-inflation asset on earth (just behind land), it has to do with gold being undestructible, you cant destroy gold literally, all gold mined in human history is still out there intact! It is also due to Gold being desirable by itself as a commodity (unlike fiat money or cyptocurrencies, gold is valuable by itself not just as an intermediary of exchange or deriving its value from somtheing else, and hence is used as a jewllery, in different industries including electronics...etc).just imagine governments banning private cryotocurrencies reolacing them with government cryptocurrencies...they cant do that to gold, because gold is physical not virtual.you can create different cryptocurrencies which reduces the value of each one of them, however you cant create a different Gold. There is only one type of gold atoms.moreover, just imagine a virus wiping out a cryptocurrency, or a successful hacking of cryptocurrency accounts, or a successful deceyption of crypto by a quantum computer...etc, none of this could happen to gold. Funny that a meteroid could wipe out dinosaurs or humans from the face of the earth, but gold would still survive! That is how resilient to catastrophes gold really is.nobody could guarantee the value of cryptocurrencies 20 years from now, let alone a hundred year or a thousand year from now. Yet you can still predict and be right, that 1000 years from now (if humanity would still be there) you can buy the same amount of food with the same quantity of gold today or 1000 years from now! hope that helped,ExpandAgain, physical vs virtual. analog vs digital. Bitcoin is NOT gold! The closest thing to gold is silver and silver is not gold either. Gold is gold. It has its own properties, uses and history. I dont see any comparison between the two. Thats like saying potatos are now new tomatos. This is only in my opinion, not offered or to be taken as financial advice. Not recommendation. Do your own research.",51237690

GLNs is 850mg/L.As you mentioned, NVX has the partnership with Tesla, and like Panasonic, theyre a battery maker (I believe). So using that association, any Chinese converter that deals with Panasonic also has a link to Tesla. Lilacs process produces LiCl (see here: https://www.lilacsolutions.com/technology)To my knowledge, production of LiCl isnt difficult, but tedious. Once ponds are operating at capacity, there are only environmental benefits to DLE.The complex part is producing battery grade LCE at scale. Its a separate process from Lilac. As you may know, ORE also produced benchtop battery grade product, but subsequently failed to do so at scale (with a starting grade of 690mg/L). Basically, every lithium miner produces battery grade at benchtop scale.Even SQM are having huge quality control issues, despite their decades of experience. That is the challenge for LKE. If they find funding for their plant, I anticipate theyll be selling 40,000 tons of technical grade lithium pa (similar quality to ORE & GXY). Alternatively, they could be producing automotive grade at a significantly higher cost than 4,800 per ton, assuming they can re-process it.Expandyou are right it is in argentinia, my mistake.. no idea who i have in mind when i think nevada... im was just trying to explain with the little i knew about it all.. i had heard about links and partnerships with NVX who supply to Tesla is all",51237686

6.6738984e+17,jgbit62,Why arent we a $500m MC company yet?,"Originally posted by mho25: ↑Yes thats what I was saying, 15Mt is the total known resource (which was 8Mt at the time of the 2019 DFS and was never the figure used for the NPV) which is different from the amount we actually mine in the first project/dfs. As per the screenshot we are only looking to mine 5.7Mt at the current known resource (so maybe more) at carlton, grants, bp33.15Mt includes the other sites which are not part of the dfs, not fully explored and may be tapped into later (see massive pyramid in every powerpoint).Your figures per ton are more pessimistic than mine so wed get around 200m npv at 5.7Mt.please see the screenshot which breakdown the underground, open pit Mt from our recent finds.ExpandCaveat I have estimated below various NPVs & divided by SOI to show cents per share value purely as a way of comparing different scenarios, not necessarily as share price targets. I used an initial NPV of A$114M from the DFS dated 19/4/19 and 1Mtpa plant & 2.6yr LOM (40 months).Lithium Step 1CXO announcement dated 30/6/20, stated 5.7Mt ore reserves 7yr LOM achieved & 10 yr LOM was within range supported by the announcement from 15/6/20 Measured & Indicated Mineral Resource of 7.62Mt, hence IMO that is what CXO are aiming to get to with the currently pending results.At 10yr LOM and all else same as the 19/4/19 DFS, NPV guessed at A$250M equates to ~A$0.25 cps at SOI pre CR or ~A$0.22 cps at post CR SOI (excluding options).With the OAs already in place/pending, expect this would be sufficient for updated DFS with LOM >=10yr and allow FID.IMO they did not need an extra A$40M just to get to this point.Latest stated timeframes to update DFS & get to FID is say mid year, complete finance then get construction started second half to late this year.Lithium Step 2With an updated DFS well underway, heading to FID and an extra A$40M, CXO can allocate more resources to growing the value of Finniss rapidly by increasing LOM to say 20yrs, est NPV A$350M or ~A$0.30 cps, or increase plant capacity to 2Mtpa at same 10yr LOM, est NPV A$500M or ~A$0.43 cps.This can occur concurrently to the update of DFS/FID process now that they have the cash to do so.Both require a significant amount of expansion drilling (therefore cost) and the 2Mtpa option requires higher capex maybe budget A$116M (deducted prestrip costs of A$30M from A$73M from DFS 1Mtpa capex and added to estimate 2Mtpa capex).Why would they bother with the extra cost of 2Mtpa? From latest CXO presentation 19/1/21, released not long before 4/2/21 placement announcement Core is receiving accelerated interest from new lithium parties for additional binding offtake and customer project finance agreements Yet they already have 71% of current production level committed to existing binding and nonbinding OAs.Also in the placement announcement dated 4/2/21 one of the highlights included preliminary LiOH design if they continue down this path they will need feed for this.Gold Step 1Without a resource estimate its hard to factor in gold into any meaningful sort of cps calculation other than to say maybe its worth 2 to 4 cps at most until it is proven up suffiently to value the potential, which they can also do concurrently with the above with some of the available funds.AIMO",51237580
6.6738984e+17,JB27,Ann: Operations Update,"Originally posted by Lazarus65: ↑I completely agree with your perspectives on Harrier for this winter. It clearly was not being seriously contemplated otherwise it would be already lined up in terms of permits etc. Remember that Charlie #1 was planned and permitted over a year before likely drilling to keep options open in the unlikely event of an early farm-out there.The Umiat acquisition is a puzzling one. Especially when considering the information you have provided regarding the roads/pipeline development costs. I suspect that costs would be lower if the connection was via Willow (or Harpoon), and even lower if permanent road requirements were minimised. But still, the question remains as to whether Umiat could ever be commercially exploited without higher PoO and also additional reserves in adjacent and enroute reservoirs (ie Peregrine).So Peregrine is important for a number of reasons: as a possible first win for the companys exploration efforts; as a bolster to the economics for any possible developer, in the success scenario; and as a means of getting one more season for fund raising and share trading.That said, the independent assessment of Peregrines prospective resources needs to be put into perspective. The numbers provided are based on Monte Carlo simulations which collectively represent a probability distribution of outcomes...in a geological success scenario. The positive/optimist spin is that the high end estimate is for 1,463 mmstbs of oil, with a mean resource estimate of 645 mmstb. The negative/pessimist spin is that the low end estimate is for only 41 mmstbs and that the entire range of outcomes from 41-1,643 mmstbs only represent the success case outcomes....which are collectively 37% of simulated outcomes. If I interpret correctly, this means that 63% of outcomes showed a fail case (effectively zero mmstbs).As has been discussed in earlier months, the mean number is just a mathematical average, while the best number is the outcome that represents the highest probability amongst all the simulated outcomes (ie the mode). The large difference between the two suggests that it is a right skewed distribution in which the model is showing that success case outcomes are more likely to be in the lower range of numbers. So the focus on mean rather than best may be misleading. Which may have an impact on sentiment and expectations mismatch to reality in a success scenario outcome.Irrespective, the outcome at the end of the drill bit will be the only number of any merit, soon enough.Frankly, I just want an unambiguous and undisputed drilling success for once with this company. Whether that (mooted/hoped for) success is of significance to advance the company agenda is another story.All IMO and GLTA.Expandthank you! and Spinefx - its posts like these I come here for, not the usual poo slinging from others. can you or anyone comment on which scenario would render the find commercial? for example, youve discussed best vs mean which was enlightening and I thank you. in the event they find best (41mbo) or even low (270mbo) concentrations of oil, is the well commercial? 41mbo sounds not a lot in comparison, but is still obviously an enormous amount of oil - or is it?",51237583

6.6738984e+17,olympian,Ann: PGM to unlock value in Scandium Project as market heats up,"Finally coming over to the real value of Skaergaard and our 31 pct holding of SIZE Teddy.Now u understand what I have been screaming about re this and now happy with our controlling stake in a Canadian based company with expertise and capability to do it justice. And also my desire to have our SIZE holding in-specie pro-rata distributed to PGM shareholders and at same time an Aussie trading platform for such established.But not yet Maximus.The comedy of it all is is that at current relative prices the BEST way into SIZE is thru PGM .......... cos PGM share cap is basically valued at our shareholding in SIZE. Thats the way it seems. Withe similar tech target pct upside for theirs and our next wave breakouts. IT SEEMS as though if they move up x5 so will we. But they dont have all the other goodies which are effectively valued at ZILCH in their kitty viz Owendale, Munni Munni Challa etc. So am very happy to enter thru PGM at current prices on relativities,Later though would love to have a mill SIZE shares to play with as they inevitably ??? (IMO) head for a bill bucks MC at time of PFS over the next year or so ??? Well 2 bucks for starters I can see. And u can see by this presentation they know what they are doing and have a good plan to bring it all to the fore , and at much more significant state than what our 2013 Scoping Study did. So yeah no urgency now BUT reckon shareholders should have a really close look at what Skaergaard fair value is going to look like after 10-15,000m DD from June and at PFS time. Love the idea of a floating turnkey camp right next to the deposit per hiring a small ship haha, Brilliant !!!Hots u should be looking closely at this. My personal gripe is I had plans of visiting the Ice Queen with RM via Moscow few years back but getting a bit old for that now. Tho dunno about the polar bears hahahaAnyway what a brilliant opportunity to load up now for what could be the mega ride of our life with PGM around friggin 5cps at market cap representing ONLY its shareholding in SIZE with all that upside intact.PLUS all our other advanced and forgotten stuffThats the way I see it and am playing it with enough core to fund two retirements if half right. Dont know why I even bother to have any traders so long as the precious metals charts have uptrends intact. AAAAND LOVE the consideration of other goodies like Copper, Titanium, Vanadium and Gallium in the later drill cores to be used toward a more comprehensive ore resource / reserve, And that starter open pit possibility is interesting with a doable strip ratio when all things are taken into account, tho I see no reason why this cant go bulk underground mining with modern tech since it outcrops to a surface start and only slopes at 20 degrees.Going to be a most interesting year or ten for the Ice Queen and PGM hey, espesh if we return to the wild and rewarding of 70s style days as is looking more and more likely.Thank you Teddy A for spotting this. PGM should at least post it as an ASX release and First Investors should be pointed in its direction dont you think ???OWEP",51237578

6.6738984e+17,prawn_man,Ann: Trading Halt,"Originally posted by Y4ukikmycow: ↑@prawnman,Regardless of the impending result, plenty of know it alls were screaming from the roof tops that Corazon did not need to raise as they had plenty of cash reserves to see them through to the end of this current drilling program and more based on their expert knowledge of Corazon and unfortunately most of those have been calling its a 10 to 100 bagger its going to be a $1 its going to the moon sort of rubbish for a very long time but of course there will always be some who continue to post facts as they arent wearing rose coloured glasses.Why would you think they need such a big raise if they are certain the next drilling will bring the results you speak of why raise so much, do they know more than the plebs of course they do sometimes it pays to look at both sides of the fence not saying it works all the time but it gives a fair an balanced view of the likely outcomes especially when dealing with a company like Corazon and its management, the one glaring factor still in all this is that none of the Board have come forward before the drilling started or after the wham bam thank you maam aerial geophysics cartoon drawings had been obtained, surely after seeing the data come back from them one would think they would be cashing all in like many who continue to doing so here, but the BOD havent and maybe for good reason when looking over the fence as in all probability they will return with zip again as Corazon is well reknowned for to continue and enjoy ones current lifestyles, of course all this is imho. ExpandY4, Im hoping the new geophysics is better than a cartoon - maybe the next time I go to the doctor Ill call an X-ray a cartoon, but I dont think the doc will be impressed. To my understanding, the geophysics being used today is a very powerful tool that has helped many junior resource companies pin-point a deposit that may never have been found without a massive drill campaign. For example, Chalice hit its high-grade nickel + copper + platinum group metals near Perth in 2020 with its first drill hole, and it was solely due to good geophysics. (Over the centuries, thousands of geologists drove past the area on the way to Kalgoorlie, but never found anything.) Previously Corazon drilled about 15 or 20 holes into the Fraser Lake complex, while Skerritt also drilled quite a few but didnt hit a target. (They did hit good intercepts of about 0.3% nickel in disseminated sulfides - good, but not good enough.) Now Corazon has a new survey with geophysicial conductance and the hope is that it will be the game-changer. The cartoon is typical of massive nickel sulfides and is supported by magnetics, chargeability and gravity. I am personnally confident that this time they are on the money. But that is just me.

Bought in at $1.95 many years ago when first hype around Rare Earth Metals. Stock went as low as $0.05 and they ended up doing a 10 for one consolidation of shares because they had issued so many. So, the $6.35 is post consolidation - pre consolidation this would be $0.635. If you bought where I originally did at $1.95, youd be waiting for this to go to $19.50 before you are back in the money. Only reason Lynas is now going up is because they are getting out of Malaysia. Building a plant in WA and have an agreement in USA.Saying that, Lynas is a completely different sector to IOU.

6.6738918e+17,1956,4DS - Anything but Charting,"Originally posted by Hateful8: ↑Hey Brother, @Acca from what I am able to gather (& old heads will know better) it stacks MLC & 3D, scales strongly (non filament), is inherently reliable and gets its vamos on like no other, it is unique and ergo previously uncharted with any real accuracy. We are developing a novel (and well-patent-protected) solution TickBrian Wang | October 22, 2016 The development of Interface Switching ReRAM, a unique type of Non-Filamentary ReRAM, represents a breakthrough in ReRAM technology and is unique to 4DS.Until raised here now, 3D scaling has never elsewhere been raised as an issue for the 4DS solutionBrian Wang | October 22, 2016 4DS Memristor achieves technical milestone of memory cells denser than 3D flashDeveloping memory storage that is not reliant upon a filament allows cell currents to scale down in line with cell size enabling the smaller geometries necessary to put more storage on a memory chip creating high density memory.A filament-less switching mechanism can operate with low switching currents, due to much more stable currents, essential for high density gigabyte range memories and the retention of data.4DS has developed a way of controlling the overall resistance of the memory cells using the diffusion of oxygen atoms across the interface and this mechanism is used to reliably control gigabyte memory intended for large-scale storage.Importantly, Interface Switching ReRAM does not rely on a destruction mechanism thereby increasing endurance, reliability and functional behaviour.Until raised here now, 3D scaling has never elsewhere been raised as an issue for the 4DS solution TickDe Gruyter | 2016: Multilevel Cell Storage and Resistance Variability in Resistive Random Access MemoryThe switching mechanism of ReRAM can be broadly classified as (i) filamentary type and (ii) interface type and is schematically shown in Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively By combining cell scalability, MLC, and 3D process architecture, ReRAM can have great potential for future ultrahigh density, nonvolatile memory applications.One of the important traits of ReRAM, which makes it useful for high density application, is its Multilevel per cell (MLC) storage behavior.ReRAM is particularly appealing for ultrahigh density and low-cost, nonvolatile memory applications owing to its excellent cell scalability, MLC storage capability and 3D stackability. MLC technology is an alternative way to increase the storage density without the requirement of decreasing the physical device size or 3D stackingJim Handy Sep 2019: Emerging Memories Today: Forecasting Emerging Memories ReRAM’s appeal is that it uses a two-terminal selector and can thus be packed very densely and can be stacked in multiple layers.Emerging technologies rarely win designs based on technical attributes. Instead they find their way into applications by providing a cost advantage. This is nowhere more clear than in today’s smart phones, which use DRAM and NAND flash even though these two technologies are extraordinarily poorly suited to battery power when compared to NOR flash and SRAM.We have listed (over many years) the metrics we have been seeking to address and with one coy (but notrelevant to this topic) exception, we have all physics and engineering topics raised, ticked off. TickFrom WDS Website: Storage Class MemoryStorage Class Memory is an emerging non-volatile memory segment positioned between the most successful system memory (DRAM) and the most successful silicon storage (NAND Flash).Ideally, Storage Class Memory has DRAM (speed & endurance) and NAND Flash (cost & retention) characteristics. However, this utopia may never see the light of day.There are many opportunities for new memories in the vast space between DRAM and NAND Flash, each with different speed, endurance and retention metrics. The 2 most extreme opportunities are The space close to NAND Flash and The space close to DRAM, each with different priorities for systems with respect to speed, endurance, and retention:Retention is everything in the space close to NAND Flash, while reaching a higher speed than NAND Flash is the opportunity for which system companies may be willing to pay a higher price per gigabyte. Whatever endurance this results in may be acceptable.Speed is everything in the space close to DRAM, while reaching an endurance as close as possible to DRAM is the opportunity, especially if this reduces the need for more expensive DRAM in systems. Whatever retention this results in may be acceptable.The main reason that retention is far less critical than speed and endurance is the space close to DRAM is that DRAM is essentially a volatile memory. Its contents need to be read and written back (refreshed) every 60 milliseconds and any retention better than DRAM saves power. The reality is that a Storage Class Memory with a retention of just one day is an astonishing 1.5 million times (or 6 orders of magnitude) better than DRAM retention. A Storage Class Memory with a retention of 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year further boosts this to 10 million, 44 million, and half a billion respectively.The biggest opportunities are always where the pain is the highest and that is in the space closest to DRAM. The ultimate market demand is therefore for Storage Class Memory with DRAM speed, the highest endurance achievable with this speed, a cost per gigabyte closer to NAND Flash, and a pragmatic retention far superior to DRAM retention.& bearing in mind this prediction was drafted a few years ago. Brian Wang | October 22, 2016 4DS Memristor achieves technical milestone of memory cells denser than 3D flashBeyond 2016: Commercial deal or strategic action most likelyFrom the current state of technological development, we essentially see three scenarios for 4DS going forward; firstly, a scenario in which the company succeeds in finalizing the minimum required development of its technology to the point where prospective licensees step up to the plate. In this scenario 4DS will need to demonstrate scalability of the Interface Switching ReRAM memory cell down to sub-45nm resolutions with consistent cell behavior using a scalable manufacturing process.Still several years of development required by licenseesAny licensee will need to further develop the technology in the next several years to the point where high density, Interface Switching ReRAM memory chips can be manufactured in existing fabs, which we would expect around 2019-2020. This development process will require tens of millions of dollars, possibly up to US$100M, in our view, which is why 4DS will likely not embark on this journey, at least not by itself.

I bought in to NAG purely on the PASS opportunity, but with the radio silence deafening I did some more homework and not sure if anyone else is aware that there are two (maybe three) other sites that can take PASS. One of them obviously taking it from Metro. Seems a lot of optimism on NAG winning the PASS contract but now not so sure. Unless anyone here knows something I dont? I dont like being negative esp being a holder but now not so sure about the risk vs return here. Just thought Id mention it.

Diamond drilling of Peppermint Grove is stated to start in April, six weeks from now BUT we have already completed the first DD (my guesstimate) from the Silver Swan workings into the high grade nickel zone. Assuming we drill an average of 50 meters a day POS will have completed an additional +3 holes (each 700 meters or more) before we hit the start date in the formal timeline. THEN we add two drills to cover 400 -500 meters across the entire Southern Terrace. So we get 10 -20 holes x 500m = 5,000 -10,000 meters ( 2 drills 50 meters per day for 100 meters) completed in 50 - 100 days PLUS 2,500 - 5,000 meters from Silver Swan workings for an extra 3-6 holes (at +700 meters). THEN we might discover that the Drill Decline is completed 1-2 weeks ahead of schedule? IMHO we are headed to 10-15 cents (at least) a share over next 2-3 months.

GLNs is 850mg/L.As you mentioned, NVX has the partnership with Tesla, and like Panasonic, theyre a battery maker (I believe). So using that association, any Chinese converter that deals with Panasonic also has a link to Tesla. Lilacs process produces LiCl (see here: https://www.lilacsolutions.com/technology)To my knowledge, production of LiCl isnt difficult, but tedious. Once ponds are operating at capacity, there are only environmental benefits to DLE.The complex part is producing battery grade LCE at scale. Its a separate process from Lilac. As you may know, ORE also produced benchtop battery grade product, but subsequently failed to do so at scale (with a starting grade of 690mg/L). Basically, every lithium miner produces battery grade at benchtop scale.Even SQM are having huge quality control issues, despite their decades of experience. That is the challenge for LKE. If they find funding for their plant, I anticipate theyll be selling 40,000 tons of technical grade lithium pa (similar quality to ORE & GXY).

Currently California is importing more than 80 - 90% of the gas from outside the state. It actually pays a premium for home grown gas supply, currently in excess of 25% according to GJ (MD SGC). Dempsey did sell commercial quantities of gas briefly but needed secondary stimulation to maintain production. That hasnt been pursued, and would require permitting. Borba on the other hand, based on seismic data, whilst being more gassy relative to Dempsey, displays sedimentary features at depth which may favour improved gas transmissivity. This is commented on numerous times by GJ in webinar interviews. If this is borne out, then you will find that Borba and surrounds will become the centre of highly profitable gas production.

The market will soon wake up to the scale and grade potential of Federation - first hole was April 2019, first resource only in June 2020. This is only going to grow quickly and once the decline is developed we will be able to drill the high grade open sections at depth. Federation is now 3.5mt at 9g/tonne of gold equivalent - let that sink in. That puts it only third to Fosterville and BGL (10g/t) in gold grade equivalent in Australia. Federation will be materially higher productive and lower cost per tonne than either of those mines. With low capex due to having a plant and site infrastructure already in place - this is going to provide incredible returns for shareholders.Kairos to kick in materially mid year and will throw off cash Copper exploration upside at Great Cobar More gold exploration upside at Dargues and Peak Stop whining about short term fluctuations in the share price and take full advantage of the weak hands",51236744

6.6738894e+17,1for1,WSB/potentIal PM sQuEEze,"Morning Botswana Metals Hodlers.Metals prices are Astro (Silver, Lead, Zinc) and demand for commodities stocks and exposure to upside from 10 years bull market as preidcted by many Economics analysts. Boab Could be at the front of line for this hungry investment money -- Boab certainly seems the most lilely to go to mine and in the short term just waiting on funding and offtake which will likely happen after the upgraded DFS. So why is Boab Lagging its peers and in a short term bear market analytically, what could be causing this lack of demand over supply for the stock (other than digital rebranding shocking).Do you think other than us handful of hotcopper investors and the registrar of long termers that anyone has discovered Boab Yet? Like all trees, Is our Boab grown from seed and still at that precarious time where an insect or gust of wind can destroy it.I spoke of the unintended conseqences of a name change in the digital era. I think its really obvious now that at open we have no buyers and this has been a trend for a couple of weeks. It signals no new investors. We have some that know of the stock buying in but mainly this is very stale and would have been an obvious short knowing this would completely vanish off screens until the word finally gets out. We kicked an own goal with the digital mistake, it will take a long time to resolve (usually i get paid to consult Boards / Owners to NOT mess with branding --- unfortunatley for me here i am a shareholder so the mistakes have hit me far worse financially than milking a wage and taking a hit to the confidence).Times i dont want vindiction . If it aint broke, dont fix it. Hoping Boab get someone to fix digital side else organically i will take 6 months to a year to get back to where we were organically.I basically invest in 4 stocks (boab, firefinch, beacon and firstgraphene) -- all are a similar market cap.. all but boab are producing -- but my focus here is on the digital.. look how well theFire finch Twitter account and linkedin accounts are going.. they must be getting thousands of views per month and loads of click throughs.. this will be from a perfect targeted group of likely cashed up investors looking for a stock to load up on.Look at First Graphene linkedin and twitter account.... same thing.. free channels getting heaps of interaction and expsosure that take virtually no time to manage as its just posting announcments and the occassional mine / bussiness update with images. Both seem to value brand visibility and understand that a big part of selling the story is rich media including images and videos ... not nessesary but when you rebrand over christmas into the wall street silver shortage year of 2021 with reckless abandon to digital visibility i say lets not split hairs on why we are being trolled by the JP Morgan guy here.. nothing to do with project viability or peers being anything on the resource we have in the best juristiction in the world close to port. IMO it all comes down to what was poor digital execution and we are dealing with it in effect -- so as stated for those in the bubble its buy time, but without new investors finding us.. the SP will have amplified vunerability to the downside assumming we dont have a white Knight in our bubble this could easily get shorted successfully..A rising silver price will float all ships so i expect Boab to lag intially today but for value investors to step up when Boab is shown to be a laggard (as we have seen on up silver days, today will be no different). Many weak hands to exit here as it dosent pop to the upside vs peers in the coming weeks imo. I will continue to hold but will try to refrain from posting here as i have been.",51236731

6.6738894e+17,imspartacus,Ann: Half Year Accounts 31 December 2020,"interesting points of view, and nice to see solid discussion on the business. Basically its a matter of unlocking the potential of Riyo. The big question is whether the board, management and current structure are able to do so.  @CaymanCeltic thanks for pointing the personnel changes, hadnt realised Turner and Choo had left.Im guessing as part of their streamlining and cost cutting, a number of roles may have had to been rationalised, combined or even relocated. As Hoofa had pointed out time and time again the biggest cost of delivering their products is staff/labour cost. So a gradual move of numbers to the Manila hub would lower the overall labour costbase. I suspect with the growth focus pivoting around the Asian operations including launching Riyo there, and Singapore based Arthur Fernandez taking the GM of Riyo role (effective July 2020) that perhaps this required some realignment of Asian based Riyo personnel. Additionally with the Riyo product transitioning from the beta/development phase to full launch a different skillset may now be needed? Agreed though, if the company culture and customer service is their moat then they best tread lightly to ensure this remains a point of differentiation. Ive from time to time kept an eye on the position vacancies, and over the past few months nearly all the roles Ive seen advertised seem to be Manila/Asian based. Time will tell, but should hopefully be a company defining 6mths, whether that be in the form of new acquisition, Riyo progress, or some further bigger ERP deals which see revenue and the books back in black. only a couple years ago management were providing the following guidance. One would hope were not far off these levels again soon...all IMO, DYOR etc....",51236716

6.6738894e+17,pagarsi,Calm the farm,"While I am not sure if he meant US or AUS dollars logic says it has to be AUS. Let’s look at what we know from other companies in similar situations. Pilbara are charging us $11 a tonne for mining. Transport is $70 per tonne. Most of our expense is $81AUS per tonne. There are smaller amounts to add on, mining village rental, head office costs and so on but these can’t possibly be more than $4 per tonne ($4 million per the million tonnes being mined). So to my reckoning our costs are no more than $85AUS per tonne. A IO price of $110-120AUS gives a healthy profit after Pilbara take their 30%.

6.6738888e+17,AxeHimmans,Ann: ADH 1H FY2021 Results Announcement,"Originally posted by LS9: ↑AxeHimmansLet me try to unpack the SOTP.Start with the Chair/CEO presentation at the 2020 AGM.This seemed to show for FY20:Adairs On-line Sales of $95mm, Channel Contribution $35mm, YOY sales growth +60%Mocka On-line Sales of $30mm, Channel Contribution $9mm, YOY sales growth +30%Adairs Stores Sales of $265mm, EBITDA $18mm, YOY sales growth -7%This in a period when 2HFY20 stores materially impacted by Covid store closures, and the Adairs online channel was force fed with locked up at home demand such that Adairs online had Apr May June growth of ~150% against PCP. Channel Contribution is a proxy for EBITDA but not perfect, as the Adairs stores EBITDA is derived by deducting the two Channel Contribution from reported Group EBITDA, which means that the Stores are wearing some of the unallocated Group overheads. Perhaps unfair, but if the online channels did not exist, the stores would have worn the overhead anyway.In 1HFY21 (see ADH ASX release)we had:Adairs on-line sales growth of 95% Mocka sales growth of 45%Adairs stores sales growth of 5%For the first 7 weeks of 2HFY21 the ADH ASX release reported:Adairs on-line sales growth of 65% YOYMocka sales growth of 50% YOYAdairs store sales growth of 12% YOYFor the purposes of generating a FY21 estimate, lets assume:Adairs on-line in H2FY21 grows only 50% YOY as it cycles the stellar Apr-May-June FY20 salesMocka in 2HFY21 holds its 50%, reflecting an improving inventory/out-of-stock positionAdairs stores in 2HFY21 has sales growth of 15%, as its cycles against FY20 closed storesThis gets us for FY21:Adairs on-line sales growth of ~75%Mocka on-line sales growth of ~50%Adairs stores sales growth of ~10%Assuming constant operating margins (no assumed operating leverage, tailwinds from FX etc) this gives FY21 forecast:Adairs online sales of $165mm and Channel Contribution/EBITDA of $60mmMocka sales of $45mm and Channel Contribution/EBITDA of $14mmAdairs stores sales of $290mm and EBITDA of $20mmFor the purposes of a prospective EV/EBITDA value, If we consider FY22 and plug in:Adairs on-line sales growth of 50%Mocka sales growth of 50%Adairs stores growth of 5%Derives FY22 EBITDA contributions ofAdairs online of $90mmMocka $20mmAdairs stores $21mmAssuming net cash of +$30mm, 10 x on the on-line businesses, and 5x on the stores we have:(110x10=1100)+(5x21=105) = EV 1205 + Net cash 30= Mkt Cap 1235 /Issued Cap 169mm= $7.30 per shareDYODDExpandThanks for breaking down your SOTP valuation. Its very helpful.On a technical point, Im afraid I must disagree that Channel Contribution can be a proxy for EBITDA, even an imperfect one. Channel Contribution is missing all group overheads. In FY20 total Channel Contribution was $109.7m at a margin of 28.2%. You then need to deduct $41.1m of group overheads to get to $68.6m of EBITDA at a margin of 16.3%. Please see the below waterfall chart from the FY20 results deck (pg 4).Your methodology allocates none of these overheads to the online business. I think this is unrealistic as it is not possible to have an online business without an executive team, product design or a warehouse (definition from same page of FY20 deck).Anyway it seems the biggest delta in our calculation is that yours is based on an FY22 projected EBITDA whilst mine was based on LTM actuals. Your projected growth rates look to be in the right ballpark to me. Only thing Id question is the 75% sales growth for Adairs online in FY21 if first 7 weeks actual was 65% and you are projecting 50% for the balance of FY21. Cheers",51236674

6.6738864e+17,Lazarus65,Ann: Operations Update,"Originally posted by spinefx: ↑usernam,With the caveat that I am no oil man, these thoughts are just my interpretation of what Ive read and understand of the projects and the company.And I may well be completely wrong, in some cases I actually wish to be wrong.But, I think only Merlin will be drilled, it is the most likely of the 2 prospects. Harrier has a lower CoS, which although upgraded from earlier announcements from XCD/88e is still high risk.I believe the 2 well program was a carrot dangled to boost the balance sheet before Dave exits the building, leaving the incoming MD cashed up. Smart move, I think.As a standalone proposition, none of the projects stack up to me. Umiat has been flow tested but the thought is that its uneconomic at anything under $70bbl, the oil there is trapped in the permafrost and requires extra infrastructure to extract. Merlin would probably be a touch less on the breakeven.The issue is the isolation of these prospects, there is no infrastructure, so to develop would require, permanent roads, pipelines, pads etc. This is an enormous cost and commitment, for someone to take on.I really believe all the projects need to be economically viable for them to be taken up as a package.Some time ago the State of Alaska did up an Environmental Impact Statement for Umiat, with roads and pipeline (across Icewine) to TAPS, the forecast cost then was ~$200 mill. The plan was shelved.Ultimately at the moment its all pie in the sky stuff until commercial/economic oil is found, only then will we see any story play out.Just my thoughts.CheersExpandI completely agree with your perspectives on Harrier for this winter. It clearly was not being seriously contemplated otherwise it would be already lined up in terms of permits etc. Remember that Charlie #1 was planned and permitted over a year before likely drilling to keep options open in the unlikely event of an early farm-out there.The Umiat acquisition is a puzzling one. Especially when considering the information you have provided regarding the roads/pipeline development costs. I suspect that costs would be lower if the connection was via Willow (or Harpoon), and even lower if permanent road requirements were minimised. But still, the question remains as to whether Umiat could ever be commercially exploited without higher PoO and also additional reserves in adjacent and enroute reservoirs (ie Peregrine).So Peregrine is important for a number of reasons: as a possible first win for the companys exploration efforts; as a bolster to the economics for any possible developer, in the success scenario; and as a means of getting one more season for fund raising and share trading.That said, the independent assessment of Peregrines prospective resources needs to be put into perspective. The numbers provided are based on Monte Carlo simulations which collectively represent a probability distribution of outcomes...in a geological success scenario. The positive/optimist spin is that the high end estimate is for 1,463 mmstbs of oil, with a mean resource estimate of 645 mmstb. The negative/pessimist spin is that the low end estimate is for only 41 mmstbs and that the entire range of outcomes from 41-1,643 mmstbs only represent the success case outcomes....which are collectively 37% of simulated outcomes. If I interpret correctly, this means that 63% of outcomes showed a fail case (effectively zero mmstbs).As has been discussed in earlier months, the mean number is just a mathematical average, while the best number is the outcome that represents the highest probability amongst all the simulated outcomes (ie the mode). The large difference between the two suggests that it is a right skewed distribution in which the model is showing that success case outcomes are more likely to be in the lower range of numbers. So the focus on mean rather than best may be misleading. Which may have an impact on sentiment and expectations mismatch to reality in a success scenario outcome.Irrespective, the outcome at the end of the drill bit will be the only number of any merit, soon enough.Frankly, I just want an unambiguous and undisputed drilling success for once with this company. Whether that (mooted/hoped for) success is of significance to advance the company agenda is another story.All IMO and GLTA.",51236459

6.6738846e+17,Destria,Ann: Major depth extensions & new footwall lodes emerge at Falcon,"De Grey Mining Limited (ASX: DEG, De Grey, Company) is pleased to provide the following drilling update at the Hemi Gold Discovery, located approximately 60km south of Port Hedland in Western Australia.The Falcon intrusion is located approximately 600m west of Brolga and immediately south of Aquila. Strong mineralisation has been defined over a strike length of approximately 1km (Figure 1). The bedrock mineralisation is covered by approximately 40m of transported material. This cover is similar to the Aquila, Brolga and Crow deposits.The mineralisation at Falcon is intimately associated with highly brecciated and extensively sulphide altered portions of the north-south orientated subvertical intrusion. The style and intensity of alteration and brecciation is similar to the nearby Aquila deposit.Significant new gold results in drilling are provided in Table 1 and Figures 1 – 5.RC and Diamond DrillingFalcon has now been tested with RC and diamond drilling to 80m x 40m spacing and a maximum vertical depth of approximately 280m. The drilling demonstrates thick zones of gold mineralisation within an intrusion up to 100m thick, 350m down dip and over 1,000m of strike. Mineralisation dips steeply to the east and remains open at depth along the entire strike length. The recent deepest holes occur on most 80m spaced sections and have intersected significant mineralisation including:− 26.3m @ 2.3g/t Au from 309m including 5.7m @ 4.4g/t Au from 325.3m in HERC298D, − 34.2m @ 1.8g/t Au from 212m including 4.0m @ 4.1g/t Au from 218.0m and 7.0m @ 3.7g/t Au from 230.0m in HERC407D, − 65m @ 1.4g/t Au from 324m including 0.5m @ 17.3g/t Au from 330.0m in HERC416D and − 55m @ 1.0g/t Au from 263m including 3.5m @ 3.6g/t Au from 298.0m and 16.5m @ 1.1g/t Au from 324.5m in HERC400DW1. A footwall lode below the main lode is becoming better defined and includes:− 20.1m @ 1.0g/t Au from 324m in HERC402D− 20.9m @ 1.9g/t Au from 369min HERC299DW1 (previously reported). Additional footwall lodes are becoming apparent in deeper drilling, as the intrusion thickens at depth.At Falcon, the next phase of drilling includes 160m spaced step out diamond holes to test the main mineralised zone at a vertical depth of around 450m and will be extended to test the new footwall lodes. This work has the potential to further significantly expand the gold endowment at Falcon.The Falcon intrusion extends for at least another 2km to the south. Drilling across this area to date has not defined significant mineralisation. However, the bulk of this work is wide-spaced, shallow aircore drilling and further drilling to effectively test this zone in more detail is required.",51236324

6.6738846e+17,Lightman1,Ann: Half Year Results - Investor Presentation,"Originally posted by Hopeful9: ↑I bought these shares in the early second half of 2020 so my comments below may lack the longer history that other holders may have.Against a background of less than impressive lottery jackpots - the aggregate was down 52 per cent on the previous corresponding period - its pleasing that revenue was up nine per cent.While underlying NPAT decreased 5.8 per cent, JIN had to shell out $15 million for its 10 year licence extension with TAH (amortised at $625000 in the period), and theres also a new service fee payable to TAH that JIN notes saw cost of sales rise by $1.876 million in 1H 21. For its lotteries division, JIN notes that the service fee will continue to increase until FY 2024.The dividend has decreased marginally to 18 cents compared with an interim of 18.5 cents in 2019-20. EPS decreased to 21.1 cents from 23.1 cents but surely the cash payment for the TAH licence must have been a factor. Very pleasing that JIN continues to account for a greater percentage of online lottery sales, up in 1H 21 to 32.1 per cent market share compared with 28 per cent previously. This to me is a key metric.Australian lotteries revenue was basically stagnant, up about in line with CPI but JIN notes that on a net basis, COVID-19 has been a positive as Australians looked for entertainment opportunities from their homes. If only jackpots would rise, the picture in revenue and NPAT for this segment would have been better. The law of averages suggests that jackpots may increase this year - or so Id like to think.There was huge growth (from a low base) of SaaS, up 1200 per cent, and managed servcies (the greater involvement by JIN in charities lotteries), up 700 per cent. Im guessing these profit centres may become increasingly important to JIN.ROIC dropped to 16.1 per cent from 18.1 per cent in the previous corresponding period.Its really pleasing that Gatherwell in the UK is doing well and that JIN was able to note lottery transaction volumes in the UK have shown an increase in the last three months.Interestingly one of the JIN investor information pages - p9 - discusses charities in Australia, Canada and the UK yet omits the USA. Is there some constraint on JIN operating in the latter regarding this part of its operations?Total JIN transaction volume was $233 million which on an annualised basis is a long way short of its $1 billion target, but others will have a better historical view of that than me.When I looked at JINs dividend payment history, a few years ago it was only paying 1.5 cents to 3 cents as an interim (2014 to 2016). Its interim announced today is its second highest ever.ExpandThe $billion target was just a guide. Never mentioned these days",51236307

New 160m spaced step out diamond drilling is underway to extend mineralisation to approximately 450m depth. The intrusion is increasing to approximately 100m thick at depth and multiple new footwall lodes are beginning to develop. Infill drilling is also providing confidence in the continuity and consistency of gold mineralisation.Falcon is open at depth and deeper step out diamond drilling is being prioritised to test this potential.These recent results, and further depth extensions, have the potential to significantly increase the already substantive gold endowment at Falcon.",51236298

6.6738834e+17,drose99,Ann: Update on PES and PEXA,"Originally posted by Spice1: ↑Report in the AFR today suggests that KKR and Domain might be teaming to buy out links PEXA stake. Couldnt read the full article though.It might offer a positive in that well get paid for it as lnk holders and could follow across to DHG to remain exposed to PEXA.ExpandKKR, Domain team up for Pexa bidPrivate equity giant KKR & Co has netted a big fish in its quest for Australian property settlement platform Pexa.Street Talk can reveal KKR is working with property listings and services giant Domain Holdings Australia on a joint bid for Pexa’s holding company Torrens Group Holdings, which is in play courtesy of a strategic review at Link Group.The KKR/Domain pairing seeks to match KKR’s deep pockets and dealmaking expertise - $US252 billion in assets under management and more than $US50 billion dry powder - with Domain’s knowledge of the Australian property market and desire to dominate all of life’s property decisions.It’s a potential coup for both parties - as long as they can stick tight as the auction heats up in coming months and agree on points such as value. Teaming up with Domain boosts KKR’s credentials over rival private equity bidders, and helps Domain work out how to fund its interest and reduces its reliance on equity capital market conditions.It is understood the pair are working together in the early stages of Pexa’s auction, which is handled by Macquarie Capital and UBS. Up for grabs is an initial 44.2 per cent stake owned by Link Group, although there are expectations one of Pexa’s two other shareholders may add some of its holding to the selldown.Hot propertyDomain CEO Jason Pellegrino. Peter BraigMacquarie and UBS kicked off the auction at the start of the month, when they sent a eight point pitch to potential buyers. It is understood bidders have signed confidentiality agreements but are yet to receive formal process letters or information memorandums, outlining Pexa in full detail.The KKR/Domain consortium shapes as one of the keenest contenders. It’s expected to come up against Macquarie’s infrastructure arm MIRA, which operates property registries in South Australia and Western Australia, and would be expected to require ACCC approval to invest in Pexa.Another angle for KKR/Domain may be the private equity partner’s blossoming relationship with Commonwealth Bank of Australia. KKR has a deal to acquire a 55 per cent stake in CBA’s superannuation business Colonial First State, and has spent the past 12 months working with Australia’s biggest bank to structure and finalise the transaction.During that time, KKR’s operatives would have had the chance to develop a strong relationship with CBA’s hierarchy. CBA owns an 11.4 per cent stake in Pexa’s holding company, Torrens. CBA has not expressed its intentions leading into the Link stake auction.Domain is 60 per cent owned by Nine Entertainment, publisher of The Australian Financial Review. KKR and Domain declined to comment.Pexa’s expected to be worth more than $2.5 billion, valuing Link’s stake north of $1.1 billion. The purpose built property transactions platform, which electronically matches funds between a property’s buyer and seller at the time of settlement, made $181 million revenue and $82 million EBITDA in the year to December 31.",51236239

6.6738834e+17,Dazedandconfused,Ann: Drilling to Resume at Mt Alexander,"Originally posted by ozblue ↑@Dazedandconfused ...This is a copy and paste from your earlier post... perhaps it is you who should reread it? I believe I caught your meaning and intention clearly enough.Apologies, I can see where my writing there is confusing. I was referring to the lack of a JORC resource with existing results not being good enough before the Canadian results; ie referring to existing results as in the metallurgy.I cannot think of any other reason not to release a JORC resource including both the oxide and sulphide as separate parts of the overall JORC resource.For any type of study, scoping or feasibility, you need a JORC resource in the measured and indicated categories before coming to any conclusions about how much, how long, what tonnage throughput for processing etc. The JORC resource sets the parameters for everything else in the studies. Doing a scoping study (or any other feasibility) before a JORC resource as announced in October 2019 always seemed strange to me without some type of JORC resource, even if it was mostly inferred.This announcement from 9th October 2019 was the first mention of a Scoping Study with the following from p1 ...https://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/displayAnnouncement.do?display=pdf&idsId=02156858Scoping studies initiated to assess a potential mining proposal at Mt Alexander:I cannot think of any junior explorer that started any type of mining study without a JORC resource, let alone still no resource estimate over 16 months after starting the study.Can you or anyone else think of any junior explorer that didnt have a resource estimate over a year after starting a scoping or feasibility study??I really like the potential of the resource here, which is why I invested, but the way this has been managed is pitiful IMHO. If the people running this were from industry, as in exploration geologists and mining development people, with lots of industry experience, (on the ground in the field) Id probably be holding a larger position, instead we have lawyers, bankers or accountants and IMHO it is showing up glaringly.ExpandWhen I first examined SGQ what stood out in my mind is the company has always been undercapitalised relative to the exploration task. It is not something I have queried management about but I think it possibly forced them to prioritize the hunt for an obvious commercial discovery.In my opinion, the current set of drill targets hold the prospect of fulfilling that objective and if it turns out that way the economic value of the near surface will become a higher priority than previously and so now we are seeing the company advance that aspect of things.",51236231
6.6738834e+17,Alexandria07,Ann: Update on Guinean Bauxite Infrastructure Solutions,Originally posted by MinerJack ↑Ok so you have no clue.Thats a shame. As Im sure investors want to know if the REE resource is even of any viable worth. But if you dont know and the company doesnt share that too. Thats fine. Im just surprised you dont know I cant see any GGG holders investors here? Just a handful you have pulled over due to them being fed up with your posts there.Im sure that doesnt help fellow shareholders here much. So why dont you stop it in their best interests? Surely that would be the right thing to do for everyone right? Or does no one else matter here?ExpandNow that you have familiarised yourself with the Saner dispute you should know that there is little point in discussing the attributes of the REE resource. I repeat that you need to wait until the Court makes a determination before discussing what value it will add to LINs capitalisation.

6.673881e+17,SteveSage,Ann: Half Year Results - Investor Presentation,"Originally posted by Hopeful9: ↑I bought these shares in the early second half of 2020 so my comments below may lack the longer history that other holders may have.Against a background of less than impressive lottery jackpots - the aggregate was down 52 per cent on the previous corresponding period - its pleasing that revenue was up nine per cent.While underlying NPAT decreased 5.8 per cent, JIN had to shell out $15 million for its 10 year licence extension with TAH (amortised at $625000 in the period), and theres also a new service fee payable to TAH that JIN notes saw cost of sales rise by $1.876 million in 1H 21. For its lotteries division, JIN notes that the service fee will continue to increase until FY 2024.The dividend has decreased marginally to 18 cents compared with an interim of 18.5 cents in 2019-20. EPS decreased to 21.1 cents from 23.1 cents but surely the cash payment for the TAH licence must have been a factor. Very pleasing that JIN continues to account for a greater percentage of online lottery sales, up in 1H 21 to 32.1 per cent market share compared with 28 per cent previously. This to me is a key metric.Australian lotteries revenue was basically stagnant, up about in line with CPI but JIN notes that on a net basis, COVID-19 has been a positive as Australians looked for entertainment opportunities from their homes. If only jackpots would rise, the picture in revenue and NPAT for this segment would have been better. The law of averages suggests that jackpots may increase this year - or so Id like to think.There was huge growth (from a low base) of SaaS, up 1200 per cent, and managed servcies (the greater involvement by JIN in charities lotteries), up 700 per cent. Im guessing these profit centres may become increasingly important to JIN.ROIC dropped to 16.1 per cent from 18.1 per cent in the previous corresponding period.Its really pleasing that Gatherwell in the UK is doing well and that JIN was able to note lottery transaction volumes in the UK have shown an increase in the last three months.Interestingly one of the JIN investor information pages - p9 - discusses charities in Australia, Canada and the UK yet omits the USA. Is there some constraint on JIN operating in the latter regarding this part of its operations?Total JIN transaction volume was $233 million which on an annualised basis is a long way short of its $1 billion target, but others will have a better historical view of that than me.When I looked at JINs dividend payment history, a few years ago it was only paying 1.5 cents to 3 cents as an interim (2014 to 2016). Its interim announced today is its second highest ever.Expandpretty average results, but as you indicated, the key division (lottery sales) impacted by lower jackpots and the higher tabcorp fees are kicking in.....they will have to run fast to keep ebitda in that division flatcouple of comments - the 32% is actually the % of lottery sales online (not JIN market share), but given JIN operate exclusively in this space, you would hope that they are benefitting from this (from what I have seen on some posts, TAH offer online as well, and in fact is cheaper than JIN, but it seems people prefer the JIN app) - they changed their reporting and Lottery division is paying the SaaS division (you can see the internal line) I suspect to highlight the SaaS business given they have talked so much about this being the driver, but without this internal charge, the SaaS business is negative EBITDAThe positives: - the SaaS TTV has a run rate of ~120m pa which means if they book 60m in TTV in 2H, they should generate ~$5m in revenues from external sources which should make it marginally EBITDA positive in 2H (without the lottery division transfer) - they seem to be getting market share as they are generating higher TTV even with lower jackpots",51236055

This rare condition has no specific treatment and a poor survival rate. Here, we describe a postnatal mouse model of PROS/CLOVES that partially recapitulates the human disease, and demonstrate the efficacy of BYL719, an inhibitor of PIK3CA, in preventing and improving organ dysfunction. On the basis of these results, we used BYL719 to treat nineteen patients with PROS. The drug improved the disease symptoms in all patients. Previously intractable vascular tumours became smaller, congestive heart failure was improved, hemihypertrophy was reduced, and scoliosis was attenuated. The treatment was not associated with any substantial side effects. In conclusion, this study provides the first direct evidence supporting PIK3CA inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with PROS.",51235987

Therefore the NPV does not grow linearly with additional tonnage mined - its better than that.Conversely, though, if the additional tonnage is used to extend mine life, then those later years make a smaller contribution to the NPV because future cash flows are discounted. At the discount rate of 10% used in the DFS, $1m of cash flow in Year 5 is only worth $590K.Also worth noting are the expected spod prices used in the original DFS: US$687 over the life of mine, at an exchange rate of 0.70. The revised DFS will surely have to use a lower spod price - its currently around US$500, though rising - and a less favourable exchange rate. Remember, the whole reason the DFS was delayed from last year was to allow spod pricing to recover.Given the above, I think an NPV of $300m is a tad optimistic for the current resource.FigaroExpandSood price used by Roskill analysts is 700 usd and all the Australian projects are based on that figure",51235949

OOH remains an attractive ad category and OML is wellplaced to leverage a recovery. Recovery is faster than expected.Event• OML’s FY20 underlying EBITDA (pre-AASB16) of $63.2m was above marketexpectations of $38.4m(65% better) due to better cost control (revenue was pre-guided).Impact• OOH benefitting from broader ad-market recovery. OML indicated1Q21YTD revenue is pacing at 80% of FY19 (‘pre-COVID’ proxy) with Road,Retail, Street Furniture at nearly 100% YTD. This was better than expected(MRE prior for Road: -19% for 1H21; -10% for retail). We now forecast +5% vsFY19 for Road in 1H21 and +6% for Retail which is broadly consistent with theother media companies and broader ad market recoveries.• FY21 is a no-fly zone. OML noted PAX assumptions for airports are expectedfor a domestic return in late 2023 and international in late 2024 (OML isdomestically exposed). We have factored this into our forecasts although noteit has historically represented a low proportion of group revenue (FY19:10.1%). We believe this would be a key growth segment for OML – particularlyin a post COVID world – although it is largely a free option.• Further rent abatements expected in FY21. OML received $63m netabatements in FY20 (Dec guidance: $54m) which underpinned the result beat.OML indicated it expects to receive a 6% or ~$4m again in FY21 with ~18%not expect to continue. The bulk of the FY21 rent relief (76%) is unknown butdependent on revenue performance. Given we forecast a top line recovery, weassume only ~38% of the ~76% (i.e. $24m) rent relief is achieved in FY21.Earnings and target price revision• Underlying EPS(huge increasing estimates) (AASB16): FY21 +370%; FY22 +92%; FY23 +143% due toless depreciation of lease assets (converting fixed to variable rents).

Admittedly, I thought we were at least 10years away from even attempting something like this here.

The Model Y SR is a configuration that CEO Elon Musk once said he would never produce because the range would be unacceptably low at less than 250 miles.Tesla first introduced this version of the Model Y Standard Range RWD with 244-mile range in 2019. Last week, Tesla slashed the base model Model Y by $2,000 to $39,990.Reference –Investors.com. (22-02-2021) Tesla Stock Dives After Zigzag On Model Musk Never Wanted.https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-latest-zigzag-model-elon-musk-never-wanted/For this reason, someone such as myself would be termed as a market laggard. The advantage being is to wait till battery technology has appeared to have peaked.This current Model Y appears to have less than a 250-mile range. So, with the so-called static type batteries that are about to hit the market, these may accommodate with a higher range, faster charging capabilities and a longer life-cycle.So, Telsa may have gauged the interest by the speed and number of orders, then stopped the orders to take advantage of any battery upgrades to enhance the static battery advantages.Apart from this, I do not read much more into this article.Reference –Research and Markets (December-2020) Technology Advances in Solid State Batteries for Electric Vehicles, 2021 Report.https://www.researchandmarkets.com/...re of Patent Ownership&utm_exec=chdo54prdThis is not adviceDo Your Own Research",51235732

6.673875e+17,Sweetsound,General Discussion Topics,"Originally posted by SplitFusion: ↑bots are nothing more than a piece of software that has instructions - they will definitely have a stop condition that will kick in when things are not predictable. I have been a software architect for over 20 years and have coded many monitor programs that look at a process and send an alert out when min / max limits are exceeded. I am absolutely sure in the the online trading world this would also be a pretty tight tolerance and would trigger the program to abort. otherwise the account that the bot is connected to could lose lots of money in a matter of seconds. The solution to a bot would be to test upper and lower limits and to estimate how long after / before the bot hits a stop condition, then create a counter bot that learns how to cause the first bot to lose consistently. Ever heard of battle bots? Of course you would have to be either a really deep-pocketed retail investor or be an institution because testing your bot could cost you tons of money, and of course the next step after you defeated the bot would be for them to launch a counter-attack. ExpandThus like I said the Bots win most of the time. These things are programmed to do certain things and do it well within set parameters. They ignore company fundamentals, emotionless, and to my knowledge simply look at price points from a technical perspective.The only way they can be beat is by having ones own strategy - for me its to hold till my internal bot SP setting has been triggered and perhaps on occasions topping up on the way on signs of weakness. This way whilst its not a nice feeling to see SP dropping pip by pip, the worrying is to a point lessened - and this is where it gets tricky - feelings and worrying is a trait Bots dont have to deal with and it is these human traits that are being exploited - and very successfully. If anyone is here for a quick buck all the best. If anyone sees potential for this company to deliver over the course of the next 2 or so years then treating this as a term deposit with some higher risk but the possible higher return may be a better option.

Given that they had just completed the equity raise I think management was somewhat reticent to hand a decent junk of the money raised straight back to shareholders in a big interim dividend. Historically MNY has been primarily equity funded and needed to do additional raisings periodically to fund the loan book growth (it was either that or retain all their earnings and pay no dividend). Now that theyve got real institutional debt facilities in place it should hopefully herald a step-change in their capital structure. Future growth can be funded with a greater mix of a debt, which will not only reduce the need for further equity but will also improve return on equity.In the context of dividends it may well free up a higher payout ratio.

6.6738714e+17,jawstwo,Morgan Stanley Reiterate Buy / 100% upside,"Originally posted by Gutfeeling: ↑Ok so I thought I use the production volume decline to extrapolate the future product in 12 months. This assumes a linear progression which may not be correct? Anyway over the prior 12 months they had production of 17313 in Mid Dec 2019 compared to 14697 in Mid Dec 2020.Using these rates It implies on a linear basis we will be producing about 12K per day come dec 2021. So the Mid point value for the year is 13400 barrels per day.Depending on oil price you get Nett cash of about 180-220M AUD per year. If we add that to our 133 M at 31st Dec it means we have about 310 - 350 M less our overheads. Then we need to start paying for the drilling, intervention program.Back in 2019 ( pre COVID) the estimated development costs from AGM where 100-120 Million USD + 30 Million for Neon well.So cica 130-150 million USD after which our product profile is circa 25K per day.I would imagine that offshore drilling costs are much cheaper now so maybe the cost to develop is 110 -130M USD?I think that the remaining 40 USD is also due May 2022.Then there is the 285M contingent payments linked to 2022 -2026. Lets assume the whole lot is payable because oil is 65USD barrel for the 5 years.Now the cost to produce drops to 17 USD per barrel. All of a sudden in say from mid 2022 we start cranking out nett cash ( before overheads) of around 1.2 Million USD per day. or 560 Million AUD per Annum.Now this could be done with Nil debt but with such low interest rates I image they will start some sort of revolving facility.Then we still have Neon. Notwithstanding black swan events or war I cant see how our SP will be anything but $4 by end of 2022. They could probably pay 15-20 cent dividend in 2022 and still have a lot of free cash.Now is the time for the patient. ExpandMining,exploration and production companies are always reluctant to pay dividends. Their first priority is management and directors. There is usually stated a generous EBIDTA but when it gets to PAT and the possibility of a dividend, the cupboard is almost bare. Look at woodside ,thanks to covid19, assets are suddenly worthless and shareholders get slapped with writedone of the order of $5 billion. Shareholder funds drop from $12 billion to $7 billion. suddenly the price of oil recovers but no write back. Look also at BHP and even S32. Billions are written off from poor decisions.

We are developing a novel (and well-patent-protected) solution TickBrian Wang | October 22, 2016 The development of Interface Switching ReRAM, a unique type of Non-Filamentary ReRAM, represents a breakthrough in ReRAM technology and is unique to 4DS.Until raised here now, 3D scaling has never elsewhere been raised as an issue for the 4DS solutionBrian Wang | October 22, 2016 4DS Memristor achieves technical milestone of memory cells denser than 3D flashDeveloping memory storage that is not reliant upon a filament allows cell currents to scale down in line with cell size enabling the smaller geometries necessary to put more storage on a memory chip creating high density memory.A filament-less switching mechanism can operate with low switching currents, due to much more stable currents, essential for high density gigabyte range memories and the retention of data.4DS has developed a way of controlling the overall resistance of the memory cells using the diffusion of oxygen atoms across the interface and this mechanism is used to reliably control gigabyte memory intended for large-scale storage.Importantly, Interface Switching ReRAM does not rely on a destruction mechanism thereby increasing endurance, reliability and functional behaviour.Until raised here now, 3D scaling has never elsewhere been raised as an issue for the 4DS solution TickDe Gruyter | 2016: Multilevel Cell Storage and Resistance Variability in Resistive Random Access MemoryThe switching mechanism of ReRAM can be broadly classified as (i) filamentary type and (ii) interface type and is schematically shown in Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively By combining cell scalability, MLC, and 3D process architecture, ReRAM can have great potential for future ultrahigh density, nonvolatile memory applications.One of the important traits of ReRAM, which makes it useful for high density application, is its Multilevel per cell (MLC) storage behavior.ReRAM is particularly appealing for ultrahigh density and low-cost, nonvolatile memory applications owing to its excellent cell scalability, MLC storage capability and 3D stackability. MLC technology is an alternative way to increase the storage density without the requirement of decreasing the physical device size or 3D stackingJim Handy Sep 2019: Emerging Memories Today: Forecasting Emerging Memories ReRAM’s appeal is that it uses a two-terminal selector and can thus be packed very densely and can be stacked in multiple layers.Emerging technologies rarely win designs based on technical attributes. Instead they find their way into applications by providing a cost advantage. This is nowhere more clear than in today’s smart phones, which use DRAM and NAND flash even though these two technologies are extraordinarily poorly suited to battery power when compared to NOR flash and SRAM.We have listed (over many years) the metrics we have been seeking to address and with one coy (but notrelevant to this topic) exception, we have all physics and engineering topics raised, ticked off. TickFrom WDS Website: Storage Class MemoryStorage Class Memory is an emerging non-volatile memory segment positioned between the most successful system memory (DRAM) and the most successful silicon storage (NAND Flash).Ideally, Storage Class Memory has DRAM (speed & endurance) and NAND Flash (cost & retention) characteristics. However, this utopia may never see the light of day.There are many opportunities for new memories in the vast space between DRAM and NAND Flash, each with different speed, endurance and retention metrics. The 2 most extreme opportunities are The space close to NAND Flash and The space close to DRAM, each with different priorities for systems with respect to speed, endurance, and retention:Retention is everything in the space close to NAND Flash, while reaching a higher speed than NAND Flash is the opportunity for which system companies may be willing to pay a higher price per gigabyte. Whatever endurance this results in may be acceptable.Speed is everything in the space close to DRAM, while reaching an endurance as close as possible to DRAM is the opportunity, especially if this reduces the need for more expensive DRAM in systems. Whatever retention this results in may be acceptable.The main reason that retention is far less critical than speed and endurance is the space close to DRAM is that DRAM is essentially a volatile memory. Its contents need to be read and written back (refreshed) every 60 milliseconds and any retention better than DRAM saves power. The reality is that a Storage Class Memory with a retention of just one day is an astonishing 1.5 million times (or 6 orders of magnitude) better than DRAM retention. A Storage Class Memory with a retention of 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year further boosts this to 10 million, 44 million, and half a billion respectively.The biggest opportunities are always where the pain is the highest and that is in the space closest to DRAM. The ultimate market demand is therefore for Storage Class Memory with DRAM speed, the highest endurance achievable with this speed, a cost per gigabyte closer to NAND Flash, and a pragmatic retention far superior to DRAM retention.& bearing in mind this prediction was drafted a few years ago. Brian Wang | October 22, 2016 4DS Memristor achieves technical milestone of memory cells denser than 3D flashBeyond 2016: Commercial deal or strategic action most likelyFrom the current state of technological development, we essentially see three scenarios for 4DS going forward; firstly, a scenario in which the company succeeds in finalizing the minimum required development of its technology to the point where prospective licensees step up to the plate. In this scenario 4DS will need to demonstrate scalability of the Interface Switching ReRAM memory cell down to sub-45nm resolutions with consistent cell behavior using a scalable manufacturing process.Still several years of development required by licenseesAny licensee will need to further develop the technology in the next several years to the point where high density, Interface Switching ReRAM memory chips can be manufactured in existing fabs, which we would expect around 2019-2020. This development process will require tens of millions of dollars, possibly up to US$100M, in our view, which is why 4DS will likely not embark on this journey, at least not by itself.

In my opinion, the Anteo team have delivered remarkable timeline adherence over the past year that has been very important for shareholder confidence.The scientific statistics that stand next to a saliva or nasal test announcement from Anteo determine the future demand for the test but also stamps the scientific standing for Anteo.While we are all looking forward to the big announcement, hurdles will have been appearing from many angles. In view of those expressed and many other implications, I’m happy for the timelines to be compromised in favour of maximising the performance value.GLTAExpandTotally agree @rogues . My non-technical take on what you posted.Every man & his dog have been releasing a rapid Covid19 test over the last 6 months. Most have been, at best , average. However, demand is so huge, the need so great, that they have all found a market and generated decent cash for their owners. I doubt any of these smaller, or new, companies in the POC market will be able to use their Covid19 test as the catalyst to becoming the next Multi-Billion Dollar player in this market.If ADO, in one fell swoop, deliver the pre-eminent test using salvia swabs, we will make global headlines, and our Covid19 test will be the catalyst to becoming the newest Multi Billion Dollar player in the POC market.This is worth waiting a few more weeks for, IMO.",51235328

6.6738696e+17,peter63,Free Money.,"Hey guys I found this over on another thread written by The Motley Fools Scotty Phillips. I thought it was worth sharing with all my mates here as we await market open.In 2012, I recommended that members of Share Advisor, one of the Motley Fool services I run, buy shares in Domino’s.The share price at the time was around $8.50 or so. (I’d check to be exact, but it hurts too much!)In 2013, sitting on a nice 40% profit and in the face of slowing growth and potential market saturation, I happily recommended our members sell.Beauty!You can’t go broke taking a profit, after all…Except.Except the shares are now (and it hurts to even type this) $105.98.Yep.That would’ve been a 12-bagger.Instead of turning our hypothetical $1,000 into $1,400 (which was nice), it could have been worth more than $12,000 instead.Or $10,000 into $120,000.You get the point.I could’ve had 11 absolute flame-outs and still broken even, had I held Domino’s until today.Yes, most of my industry and the media (and more than a few members) focus on trying to avoid losing 20, 30 or 40%. And that’s not wrong. If you can avoid losing money, you should.But I dare say most (if not all) investors would do themselves a favour by recalibrating their gaze to the ones that got away (the ones they either sold too early or never held at all).I’m not even talking about cherry-picking the very best performing stock on the ASX and giving yourself grief for not buying it.You can’t buy every winner -- and if you owned everything, you’d just end up with the market’s average result anyway.But my Domino’s experience has taught me a few lessons.First, be slow to buy, and even slower to sell. Yep, write that down, and re-read it often. When you own a quality business, I reckon you should part company with it only reluctantly, and give it plenty of rope before you do..Second, by all means assess the risk of losing money, but also consider the risk of not making money. That is, consider the full range of outcomes. Turns out I was wrong to sell Domino’s. But even if I was right and Dominos business was maturing, maybe the shares might have fallen 25% or 40%. Painful, sure, but the potential for a 1,200% gain makes up for a lot of smaller losses.Third, don’t be blinded by your own mistakes. I’m happy to say I (belatedly) again recommended our members buy Domino’s, in 2018, at around $42. It would have been silly (and stubborn and arrogant) to stick my head in the sand and refuse to acknowledge my mistake. No, it doesn’t make up for the missed opportunity altogether, but at least we’ve gone some way to minimising the cost of the mistake.Here’s the hard part: Now it’s over to you.I can’t make you change your approach. Some of you, despite my best efforts, will still prioritise avoiding losses over maximising gains. That’s fair enough. You need to invest the way you think is best for your circumstances, personality and risk tolerance.But I hope that this will strike a chord with at least some of you.I hope you’ll realise that investing is a portfolio game, where the aim is to maximise the long term value of the total portfolio, not minimise the number of individual losing investments you make. I hope you’ll realise that, well chosen, a portfolio of companies with big potential gains, appropriately handicapped for the odds of success, has a good chance of beating a portfolio of companies chosen to minimise the chance of individual loss. Perhaps even by a decent margin.",51235292

I have communicated directly with the company and also was at the webinar yesterday. The openness is refreshing not only for this company but for any listed company, who have to be careful what they say. I agree with T.E.P. in that there is strong signalling that while it doesnt make it overt that the contract renewal is certain, it shows that there are a couple of things which make it almost unavoidable. I think the chance of renewal is more than 95%, but 95% is good enough to justify the position.More importantly the company has identified growth opportunities and is taking steps to realise them. My feeling about the companys history is that as a technology provider, the conventional perception is that they continue to innovate the platform and leverage that platform, but until now they have just been a bit like a software contract shop, adding bits of functionality according to requests. Now they are pushing in some new directions which were covered in yesterdays call, and they are building confidence and relationships with their investors.

That said with other potential ground such as Bronzewing in WA and the other Mt Isa 100% HMX owned ground not to mention Trafalgar (who knows what’s there?) any further significant discovery/s it it obvious why people are excited here! Any future discoveries or JORC upgrades adds to the value. And luckily enough for Hammer shareholders it has multiple prospects and targets!At a closing price of .13 cents the market cap of HMX is $ 97.51m Hammer sits just shy of the $100m.This as I understand is very important threshold as institutions have certain criteria to buy shares (market cap is one) and if this ($100m) is passed as I understand it opens HMX up to further institutional investors. (confirmation required please?)Gold Road when they came out with an intial JORC resource some 10 months (they did a great deal of work to confirm in such a short period of time) after the Gruyere (Ziggy) discovery, Gold Road announced a maiden JORC 2012 Mineral Resource of 96.93 million tonnes grading 1.23 grams of gold per tonne for 3.8 million ounces of contained gold. (DYOR).At that time GOR share price was around 30c-40c. I know these guys were very conservative on both the jorc but also the price of gold for their estimates, and over time revised the oz’s and price up as further exploration confirmation and spot prices increased over time.So with copper prices going gang busters Hammer is very well placed it has a new significant discovery at Trafalgar (per Jan 2021 ASX announcement) the question is just how big and how many more (than the 400) KT’s (kilotonnes = 1000 metric tonnes)?At current prices over $8,800 per tonne for copper any confirmed JORC upgrade or further new discovery/s adds further significant value even at a fraction of of spot price.And that’s not even factoring in any further increase with the copper/gold prices!IMO very exciting times ahead, and no wonder..it appears from the trading today that the market is starting to finally wake up to the potential of HMX.Good luck to all holders.Cheers AussieExpandAussie, you have got me thinking, with the talk of what Hammeris worth.Now I am no expert so please don’t crucify me. What you are saying is Hammer has already a Jorcresources of over 400kt of copper equivalent.Without taking in consideration of Bronzewing South or therecent Trafalgar discovery my back of envelope figures are outstanding. 400,000 tonnes of copper at $8800 US a tonne ($11117 equivalentAUD today)400,000 x $11,117 = $4.4 Billion in the ground.Question: What would it cost to get it out of the ground?Hypothetically speaking if it cost half to get it out, wewould be left with $2.2B$2.2B with 750M shares on issue equates to approximately $2.95per share.I have nothing to back up my valuations, but with everythingelse these guys are doing as well, you have to admit it’s pretty amazing.I don’t think the current stock price has taken this intoconsideration.",51235181
6.6738678e+17,Fact Finder,2020 BRN Discussion,"Originally posted by rayz: ↑Artificial Intelligence and National Security Updated November 10, 2020Congress may consider the growth of international competition in the AI market and the danger of foreign exploitation of U.S. AI technology for military purposes. In particular, the Chinese government is reported to be aggressively pursuing AI investments in the United States. Amid growing scrutiny of transactions involving Chinese firms in the semiconductor industry, in September 2017 President Trump, following the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), blocked a Chinese firm from acquiring Lattice Semiconductor, a U.S. company that manufactures chips that are a critical design element for AI technology. In this way, some experts believe that CFIUS may provide a means of protecting strategically significant technologies like AI . Indeed, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS’s ability to review certain foreign investments, including those involving emerging and foundational technologies. It also authorized CFIUS to consider whether a covered transaction involves a country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in areas related to national security. Congress may monitor the implementation of FIRRMA and assess whether additional reforms might be necessary to maintain effective congressional oversight of sensitive transactions. AI Applications for Defense DOD is considering a number of diverse applications for AI. Currently, AI R&D is being left to the discretion of research organizations in the individual services, as well as to DARPA and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA).However, DOD components are required to coordinate with the JAIC regarding any planned AI initiatives costing more than $15 million annually. In addition, the JAIC has been tasked with overseeing the National Mission Initiatives (NMI), projects that leverage AI to address pressing operational challenges . The JAIC began work on its first two NMIs—predictive maintenance and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief—in 2019. According to former JAIC acting director Nand Mulchandani, the JAIC then shifted its focus to joint warfighting and, in May 2020, awarded an $800 million contract to Booz Allen Hamilton to bring AI to the battlefield. Current JAIC director Lt. Gen. Michael Groen has stated that the JAIC is now focused on further developing databases and software tools for use in AI projects through the department.AI is being incorporated into a number of other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications, as well as in logistics, cyberspace operations, information operations, command and control, semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles, and lethal autonomous weapon systemsThe intelligence community also has a number of publicly acknowledged AI research projects in progress . The Central Intelligence Agency alone has around 140 projects in development that leverage AI in some capacity to accomplish tasks such as image recognition and predictive analytics . IARPA is sponsoring several AI research projects intended to produce other analytic tools within the next four to five years. Some examples include developing algorithms for multilingual speech recognition and translation in noisy environments, geo-locating images without the associated metadata, fusing 2-D images to create 3-D models, and building tools to infer a building’s function based on pattern-of-life analysis. Cyber Space Commander of U.S. Cyber Command Admiral Michael Rogers stated that relying on human intelligence alone in cyberspace is a losing strategy. He later clarified this point, stating, If you can’t get some level of AI or machine learning with the volume of activity you’re trying to understand when you’re defending networks ... you are always behind the power curve. Conventional cybersecurity tools look for historical matches to known malicious code, so hackers only have to modify small portions of that code to circumvent the defense. AI-enabled tools, on the other hand, can be trained to detect anomalies in broader patterns of network activity, thus presenting a more comprehensive and dynamic barrier to attack. FlightThe Air Force Research Lab completed phase-two tests of its Loyal Wingman program, which pairs an older-generation, uninhabited fighter jet (in this case, an F-16) with an inhabited F-35 or F-22. During this event, the uninhabited F-16 test platform autonomously reacted to events that were not preprogrammed, such as weather and unforeseen obstacles DARPA completed testing of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel prototype, or Sea Hunter, in early 2018 before transitioning program development to the Navy Sea Hunter has since been integrated into Surface Development Squadron 1, which has been tasked with overseeing fleet familiarization, training and tactics development of [unmanned surface vessels]. If Sea Hunter enters into service, it would provide the Navy with the ability to autonomously navigate the open seas, swap out modular payloads, and coordinate missions with other unmanned vessels—all while providing continuous submarine-hunting coverage for months at a time. Some analysts estimate that Sea Hunter would cost around $20,000 a day to operate, in contrast to around $700,000 for a traditionally inhabited destroyer....SWARM Swarm Characteristics Autonomous (not under centralized control) Capable of sensing their local environment and other nearby swarm participants Able to communicate locally with others in the swarm Able to cooperate to perform a given task Secrets Furthermore, as Assistant Attorney General John Demers has testified to Congress, from 2011-2018, more than 90 percent of the [Justice] Department’s cases alleging economic espionage by or to benefit a state involve China, and more than two-thirds of the Department’s theft of trade secrets cases have had a nexus to China.ExpandSecrets Furthermore, as Assistant Attorney General John Demers has testified to Congress, from 2011-2018, more than 90 percent of the [Justice] Department’s cases alleging economic espionage by or to benefit a state involve China, and more than two-thirds of the Department’s theft of trade secrets cases have had a nexus to China.Hi rayzGreat series of posts covering US DoD and where BRN may be hiding.

Now, whether or not that order disappears just before the market opens, I dont know...is it some peanut trying to scare off possible buyers, and attempting to give the impression theres a reason to sell? I hold, in various facilities, over 4 million PDN, and have been very pleased with the increase in the past few months - mind you, I have also lived with the uncertainty of the uranium market for some years, but now, as it all appears to be coming together, Im more convinced than ever, that we are on the cusp of a determined upswing in valuations.Just my thoughts....Im holding for another 1-2 years, and will watch (with pleasure) the inevitable rise in the value of many of my uranium holdings in various companies (BOE, BMN, PDN and DYL).Good luck to all who subscribe and contribute to the discussion boards - hopefully, 2021 will be a ripper year!ExpandIt definitely looks like a capper showing that size order upfront, but see what happens when the market opens.

On the other side, I have more confidence now, even if it is trading at 60c, because now I know that some 3 institutions can bet on putting 15-20m each and more important is that the company has got the money which we were waiting for last 4 years. So without money, $1 is not worth but with $54m in the bank 60c is much worth it. Just need to wait.",51235025
6.6738642e+17,Hopeful9,Ann: Half Year Results - Investor Presentation,"Originally posted by ASX News: ↑Release Date: 23/02/21 08:18Summary: Half Year Results - Investor PresentationPrice Sensitive: YesView DocumentExpandI bought these shares in the early second half of 2020 so my comments below may lack the longer history that other holders may have.Against a background of less than impressive lottery jackpots - the aggregate was down 52 per cent on the previous corresponding period - its pleasing that revenue was up nine per cent.While underlying NPAT decreased 5.8 per cent, JIN had to shell out $15 million for its 10 year licence extension with TAH (amortised at $625000 in the period), and theres also a new service fee payable to TAH that JIN notes saw cost of sales rise by $1.876 million in 1H 21. For its lotteries division, JIN notes that the service fee will continue to increase until FY 2024.The dividend has decreased marginally to 18 cents compared with an interim of 18.5 cents in 2019-20. EPS decreased to 21.1 cents from 23.1 cents but surely the cash payment for the TAH licence must have been a factor. Very pleasing that JIN continues to account for a greater percentage of online lottery sales, up in 1H 21 to 32.1 per cent market share compared with 28 per cent previously. This to me is a key metric.Australian lotteries revenue was basically stagnant, up about in line with CPI but JIN notes that on a net basis, COVID-19 has been a positive as Australians looked for entertainment opportunities from their homes. If only jackpots would rise, the picture in revenue and NPAT for this segment would have been better. The law of averages suggests that jackpots may increase this year - or so Id like to think.There was huge growth (from a low base) of SaaS, up 1200 per cent, and managed servcies (the greater involvement by JIN in charities lotteries), up 700 per cent. Im guessing these profit centres may become increasingly important to JIN.ROIC dropped to 16.1 per cent from 18.1 per cent in the previous corresponding period.Its really pleasing that Gatherwell in the UK is doing well and that JIN was able to note lottery transaction volumes in the UK have shown an increase in the last three months.Interestingly one of the JIN investor information pages - p9 - discusses charities in Australia, Canada and the UK yet omits the USA. Is there some constraint on JIN operating in the latter regarding this part of its operations?Total JIN transaction volume was $233 million which on an annualised basis is a long way short of its $1 billion target, but others will have a better historical view of that than me.When I looked at JINs dividend payment history, a few years ago it was only paying 1.5 cents to 3 cents as an interim (2014 to 2016). Its interim announced today is its second highest ever.",51235021

Im quietly confident that this carbonatite dyke is highly prosperous for rare earth minerisation. Apatite rich ferrosoviteMt Weld carbonatite complex of Western Australia intrudes an Archean greenstone sequence dominated by basic and ultrabasic metamorphosed igneous rocks. Carbonatites form the core of the complex and are surrounded by glimmerites. The dominant carbonatite is sövite and is intruded by rauhaugites and carbonate-rich veins. The present investigation examines the mineral chemistry and petrology of the layered rauhaugites. They are essentially composed of ferroan dolomite, mica, magnetite and apatite,Phosphorus grades and underlying geology is similar to Mt Weld.Soil sampling is good first step to test for lathanides and other rare earths but utlimately would like to see a small drill program put in place the intercept the dykeLynas Mt weld below.Post #:50291281 contains more details and links relating to this.Also spoke with the PSC team recently. Was pretty tight lipped but had said that the lithium market was indeed starting to heat back up. Current focus was getting to production as soon as practicable, and hopeful that they could announce something to the market. i recall a phase 1 (one train) production profile being called out in a previous presentation. With full capex as per DFS being in the 200m range i can see a reduced profile costing more than say 80m. With the current backing of seven hills, U1 etc i can see this being feasible. Pilot plant is also due to be operational this quarter. IMV thats a substantive de-risk in terms of the process flow sheet can be tweaked easily on site rather than having to liaise through labs. Sitting patiently and have taken a little more here as the charts suggesting were in the bottom of a channel.Stochastics flicked up, MACD close to green and bounced off the channel. Looks seriously good if it moves above 18c in the next couple days. Target is low 30s in h1 which is still only 15% of NPV. Given, pilot plant, offtakes, ML and production target with 1-2 years i think 30-50% is much fairer. Goes up again once finance is secured. Finally spodumene pricing now up to $450USD/t with futures shifting ahead. Lithium carbonate/hydroxide pricing up 70% since Nov 2020. Demand will begin to outstrip supply in the short and medium term which only improves the optic for developers. Shoe will now be on the other foot.also on petalite, https://www.prospectresources.com.a...nouncements/Terra Studios Petalite Report.pdf some old links which show bikita producing 50,000-70,000tpa of this. So its not a fantasy. Also pricing is higher than spodumene equivalent. See below from independent sources. Pricing has decreased like spod but the premium remains.PREMIUM PRICING Product quality and rarity attracts premium pricing despite overall price weakness for lithium products. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence confirmed that in May and June 2019 low iron petalite concentrates sales in China ranged between US$1,300 and US$1,400 per tonne, well above the US$749/dmt average selling price recorded for the June quarter at the Bald Hill mine or the US$600/dmt (CIF China) realised by Altura Mining at Pilgangoora.https://www.avalonadvancedmaterials.com/_resources/reports/AVL-SeparationRapids-PEA2018.pdfhttps://www.prospectresources.com.a...rra Studios, Low Iron Concentrate Reports.pdfSF2TH",51234932

6.6738606e+17,Merlin88,Ann: Sunstone Gold Projects Acquisition Update,"Originally posted by NordicInformer: ↑Dear Merlin,Delay in answering was caused by our night.The lowest cost for an appeal is 260 euros for the first level administrative court and 510 euros for the highest level court,in case you would not win any point with you appeal. With secondary points/requirements risk for these may be lowered.For skilled and active communities the time may be the biggest cost.Some people and movements have used tens of thousands with law firms, only sky is the limit for the cost. The result is seldom much better than by experienced civil society.I think it is the same for exploration and mining companies, but in most cases at least foreign companies would use consultants or even the most expensive law firms.I think we do not discriminate between Finnish and foreign miners. Apparently the failure to appeal Sunstone was either lack of organization of the local movement or based on their, now unfortunate, analysis that the project was not credible and financed enough to be challenged. I agree, that it is totally unfair to investors and companies, that state agency GTK is still marketing the any mineralisation to foreign and Finnish companies without any consideration about environment or social license. You can find their marketing brochures in the web. Normally the customer copies the GTK stuff to start with. I am really sorry about that. I do realize that the conflicts created by the state mining people are not good for the reputation of the country. On the other hand, I recognize the same problem with mining authorities in other countries. I think it is in the basic education of geologists and mine engineers lacking environmental and social education.I had a bit sarcasm with comments about Argentina. It is matter of opinion how good it would be, but as far as I know it would be quite unlikely to get even an open pit with results under 1 gram/ton with very rare exceptions. In Raahe the estimate was 2 grams, but when the yield was about 1 gram, the company now called Otso Gold has been struggling for restart more than 7 years.I have seen the Mason speech about multi million ounce resources and would consider that if NZ would not be any better,they are trying to get the next millions with holes relatively close to Hopeavuori, old Sotkamo/GTK, or Satulinmäki, old Sunstone, best drillings, otherwise they may run out of credibility. But we shall see.Regards NordicExpandSo Nordic thanks for being forthcoming with information with answers to questions. I’m going to continue to pick your brain if I may as what you say may or may not be of actual benefit to shareholders here. Did your group appeal the leases (particularly Hopeavuori) when Sotkamo possessed them? If so were they still in dispute when they were on sold to New Peak? In the event that the appeal is rejected and permission to drill is granted, can a new appeal be lodged and theoretically how many appeals can the appealing party exhaust before finality is achieved?",51234861

If end of next year after possible positive clinical results, they value would be significantly higher.immunomedics was 21b after a successful phase II, but keeping in mind they also got fast tracked FDA approved. So Gilead bought a market ready drug(I believe?).

6.67386e+17,vmp,ASX Today,"Originally posted by anatol ↑Its all good.The KV Project resource value is at least $1.5b in todays lithium market conditions. (I explained my valuation benchmarking methods on my previous posts.Post #:​48102488)When it comes to the integrated solution (mine + concentrate process plant + chemical refinery) then the market cap of LTR can easily go over $2.5b in conservative terms when a benchmarking is done with other intergrated developers and miners. (It implies to $1.40 sp).BSCPs 90c price target is apparently a conservative one as well. I know BSCP is always more conservative than me, because when my target price was 20c their was 10c, when mine is 40c their was 21c, then when mine was 70c their was 43c.Now their price target is 90c while mine is $1.40. (Only for KV project)I am considering a lot of other factors and forecasts when making my price prediction; lithium developers, explorers, what they have got, what is the chance of finding a Tier-1 new resource, the new development in Li-Ion battery technologies, which Tier-1 battery producers are making JVs with which battery metals producers, etc, etc. its very comprehensive. (For example my last research was about QuantumSpaces solid state battery hype. I decided that QS is making a lot of BS, the solid state battery technology is far from being economic, conventional Li-Ion tech will be the dominant technology for the next 20-30 years. SS Battery will be used in nitche areas but will not be the mainstream during that period. I have decided that after making couple of days research with a lot at the backgorund).The lithium wars for Li-Ion batteries (for every kind of EVs and all mobile products, and wearables) are just starting.Its going to be an unbelievable run for the lithium investors.The large holders of LTR can consider themselves as lithium sheikhs of 21st century.Tim Goyder is being the King of Lithium Valley.Good luck to everyone.Expand@anatol what I like about this update is that it finally highlighted the superiority of the KV project compared to KDR’s Mt Holland. KV is close to all infrastructure including source of sulfuric acid and also much less cost waste disposal and transport costs. In contrast - It should also be noted that Mt Holland is a remote mine, without access to grid power (hence renewables), potable water, an all-weather airstrip, a camp and a bituminised highway for transport of 2mtpa SC6 to Kwinana. And then there is the issue of waste disposal, which, as we demonstrated for the Kemerton project, could be extremely expensive indeed. We shudder to think how much a 40-50mt capacity tailings dam would cost at Kwinana. Has that been built into the WES/SQM estimates?‘As acknowledged throughout the report 90 cents is conservative. Potential partners are Rio Tinto, FMG, South32 and Iluka. Grades in the first 10’years are 1.6%.Up until now the market fell in love with hypes and has not recognised how much more compelling KV is.",51234823

I am absolutely sure in the the online trading world this would also be a pretty tight tolerance and would trigger the program to abort. otherwise the account that the bot is connected to could lose lots of money in a matter of seconds. The solution to a bot would be to test upper and lower limits and to estimate how long after / before the bot hits a stop condition, then create a counter bot that learns how to cause the first bot to lose consistently. Ever heard of battle bots? Of course you would have to be either a really deep-pocketed retail investor or be an institution because testing your bot could cost you tons of money, and of course the next step after you defeated the bot would be for them to launch a counter-attack.

If you go back to their feaso they were fairly conservative. They assumed a reasonable amount of dilution on grade as part of the mining studies. Also if you look at their grade control drilling its actually been a fair uplift in grade vs what was modelled in the feasibility. I tabulated all the infill holes from the table at the back of the mid Jan release and from memory interval weighted grade was around 1.5g/t which is meaningfully above the 1g/t reserve for OP.As for the U/G I suspect it will be sometime before that is mined.

IHR have subscribers across 18 countries now, with 41% of subscribers being overseas, as per the update.

They already have enough drilling results and metallurgical recovery results to come up with one, but are waiting for the Canadian results for the Scoping study and JORC resource estimate, why?? The only conclusion I can come to is that existing results are not yet good enough to have a positive market effect, or any effect (perhaps down being below market expectations?) on the market.I am no fan of cheer squads either. My money is still sitting on the table and I also welcome critical analysis.Expand@Dazedandconfused ...This is a copy and paste from your earlier post... perhaps it is you who should reread it? I believe I caught your meaning and intention clearly enough.Apologies, I can see where my writing there is confusing. I was referring to the lack of a JORC resource with existing results not being good enough before the Canadian results; ie referring to existing results as in the metallurgy.I cannot think of any other reason not to release a JORC resource including both the oxide and sulphide as separate parts of the overall JORC resource.For any type of study, scoping or feasibility, you need a JORC resource in the measured and indicated categories before coming to any conclusions about how much, how long, what tonnage throughput for processing etc. The JORC resource sets the parameters for everything else in the studies. Doing a scoping study (or any other feasibility) before a JORC resource as announced in October 2019 always seemed strange to me without some type of JORC resource, even if it was mostly inferred.This announcement from 9th October 2019 was the first mention of a Scoping Study with the following from p1 ...https://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/displayAnnouncement.do?display=pdf&idsId=02156858Scoping studies initiated to assess a potential mining proposal at Mt Alexander:I cannot think of any junior explorer that started any type of mining study without a JORC resource, let alone still no resource estimate over 16 months after starting the study.Can you or anyone else think of any junior explorer that didnt have a resource estimate over a year after starting a scoping or feasibility study??I really like the potential of the resource here, which is why I invested, but the way this has been managed is pitiful IMHO.

The bulk sample is for the primary purpose of confirming the metallurgical characteristics (including mineral recovery rates) using conventional sulphide flotation processing methods. Metallurgical testwork to date has yielded total recoveries of up to 90.3% Zn, 92.3% Pb and 82.3% Ag, producing separate zinc and lead concentrates.The Silver Ray Lode is characterised by high-grade zinc-lead-silver mineralisation, with intercepts including:• 13.5m @ 21.1% Zn, 14.1% Pb, 268g/t Ag from 82m in MBDD028• 12m @ 20.3% Zn, 14.8% Pb, 308g/t Ag, 1.59g/t Au from 83m in MBRC024• 9m @ 20.8% Zn, 10.6% Pb, 338g/t Ag, 1.91g/t Au from 88m in MBRC085The bulk sample will be hauled to CBH’s Endeavour Mine Site for testing. No processing or tailings production will be undertaken at the Mallee Bull site.Sandfire has quite a few irons in the fire and a scrip TO would be nice at a decent premium to PEXs current price.Not sure if SBM, HHM and PEX Management would let go of their stake willingly................ they have more than enough of a holding to hold out.PEXs multiple deposits and speckled JV ownership and Royalty arrangements up until recently have muddied the waters when looking at what they actually have in the ground........................... thats all history as the complete thing is now under their control.MIExpandIf only Peel Mining had a MD who had the wherewithal to do something, anything, to get plans afoot to fund and build a mine.

6.673854e+17,Hot News,News: MQG UPDATE 7-Australias Macquarie reaps windfall profits from U.S. winter freeze,"Macquarie expects profit to jump by up to 10% Australian company is second biggest gas marketer in N. America U.S. gas sales turn around profit outlook for the global bank (Adds closing share prices) Macquarie Group (MQG) earned big profits off the winter storms sweeping across Texas and other U.S. states, with the gains from its trading operations single-handedly changing the Australian banks outlook for the year. The company is the second-largest gas marketer in North America behind oil major BP BP.L , and the week of big trading revenue has by itself boosted the banks overall profit outlook for the year by 10%. The windfall comes after nearly a week of frigid temperatures that knocked out power for millions of people in the United States, particularly in Texas, forcing many to spend several nights without heat or electricity. Some consumers are also expected to face monumental utility bills in coming months as a result of Texass largely unregulated system. Macquarie on Monday said it expects fiscal 2021 profits to jump by as much as 10% after warning just two weeks ago that earnings would be slightly down. The companys energy business unit trades large quantities of gas to meet unexpected consumer demand, and it could boost the banks overall profit by about A$400 million ($317 million), analysts said. Extreme winter weather conditions in North America have significantly increased short-term client demand for Macquaries capabilities in maintaining critical physical supply across the commodity complex, the company said in a statement. The deadly winter storm that crippled infrastructure and left millions of Texans without power meant electricity generators had to compete for natural gas supplies, pushing up prices sharply in the deregulated market.Macquarie appears to be capitalising well on volatility and financial market dislocation, Bank of America Securities analysts said in a note, as it increased its earnings forecasts for the Sydney-headquartered company. Macquaries shares closed up 3.5% to A$147.15 on Monday, the highest level in a year, outperforming the broader market (xjo) that was flat. Macquarie purchases natural gas and moves it along pipelines and grids, typically from areas where usage is low to high-demand markets. They have access to a lot of gas and likely had some in storage, plus they likely also had firm transportation agreements which means they were able to transport their molecules while others were displaced, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. Macquaries performance hurt last year by the pandemic, with subdued deal-making and deteriorating economic conditions leading to a rise in impairment charges. But a strong initial public offering of its majority-owned data analytics software business, Nuix, late last year and a fillip in the energy business have helped push its share price back to pre-pandemic levels. The company, which also operates Australias largest asset manager and investment banking business, is set for extra boost from a rebound in local M&A activity this year. Earlier this month, the Sydney-based financial conglomerate had forecast full-year earnings for the group to be slightly lower than in fiscal 2020. Macquaries Commodities and Global Markets division contributes close to 40% of its group earnings. Analysts had previously raised concerns that the pandemic could erode profits from the division if high energy-use industries shuttered. sales by its US gas businesshttps://tmsnrt.rs/2ZDW4u8 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>",51234530

The best investors can disengage share price performance from underlying business performance and take advantage of those who cant.Those are significant holdings Luke, and I completely respect your investing style. Everyone has a different risk tolerance and investing style. Everyone also needs to come to their own investment decisions. It is precisely because many people are in a similar situation to you, that the renewal of the GM contract will cause a significant price surge. Plenty of investors are sitting on the sidelines and will jump on this train once the renewal word is surfaced in an ASX price-sensitive announcement.Of course, once the renewal risk is completely removed -- the lower the share price upside compared to todays levels. There is no major reward without some level of risk in life. Fortune favours the brave.One final piece of the puzzle that might interest some here is that ad-hoc consulting works (i.e. product upgrades) for the GM product have already been approved with timelines that extend beyond the end date of the overall GM contract (August).Cheers,T.E.P.",51234414

6.6738516e+17,LaVitaBella,Shenghe Resources Building International Alliances,"By Mary HuiReporterFebruary 19, 2021As the US takes steps torestore a full rare earths supply chain onto American soil, a Chinese rare earths giant is embedding itself more deeply into the global supply chain.China iscurrently the world’sdominant producer of rare earths, used in a wide range of advanced tech products, having taken that crown from the US in the 1990s. Because of their crucial role in the global economy, rare earths hold national security importance and their supply chain is as much a matter of geopolitics as business. As the US seeks to reduce dependence on China, China’s shoring up its dominance by more closely regulating itsdomestic resources, while at the same time expanding ties with businesses and projects worldwide. At the center of that global strategy is Shenghe Resources.TheShanghai-listed company is one of a few rare earth firms in China withoperations spanning every part of the supply chain, from mining the minerals toprocessing them into higher-grade material to using the processed metals inhigh-tech products. It is already involved in major rare earths projectsabroad, including in the US, Vietnam, Greenland, and Australia, where it isalso developing new partnerships.Against thisbackdrop, a forthcomingexecutive order from US president Joe Biden to review the country’s critical supply chains is expected to include rare earths. Industry experts and politicians alike have urged the US to team up with allies like Japan and Europe to counter China’s dominance. Though Washington has inked deals with Australia and Canada to collaborate on rare earths, it must also contend with a China that’s aggressively pursuing global alliances—and reportedlyconsidering using rare earth export restrictions to undermine the US defense industry.A global game-planEarlier thismonth, Shenghe signed a memorandum of understanding with Australian rare earths company RareX. The agreement lays the groundwork for a majority Shenghe-owned joint venture and potential Shenghe investment in RareX’s rare earths project in Western Australia. Meanwhile, a public consultation is underway for a major rare earths project in Greenland that Shenghe has a minority stake in, and for which it hopes to soon acquire a mining permit from Greenland’s government.The partnershipsmark an effort to deepen the three grands (link in Chinese) strategy that Shenghe’s chairman Hu Zesong emphasized in 2017, which includes the grand breakthrough in overseas rare earth resources. The firm’s strategic plan (link in Chinese) for the next two years involves consolidating the results of overseas cooperation projects so as to guarantee a stable supply of rare earths. This is particularly important for China, which in recent years has become a net importer of rare earths, critical to establishing electronic manufacturing prowess in smartphones, electric vehicle batteries, and military equipment.Hu’s speech camethe same year Shenghe made one of its most significant overseasinvestments. It has an 8% stake in MP Materials, an American company thatoperates the only active rare earthsmine in the US. The California mine, Mountain Pass, was bought out of insolvency in 2017 by a rescue consortium that included Shenghe—and secured the Chinese company rights to MountainPass’s output.According to MP’slisting prospectus filed last October, Shenghe is currently the firm’sprinciple source of revenues as the sole buyer of MP’s rare earth concentrate,which Shenghe sends to China for processing. In its 2020 earningsforecast published lastmonth (pdf, link in Chinese), Shenghe credited its stake in MP as the primary reason for its almost 200% growth in net profits compared to 2019. Shenghe’sminority stake in MP prompted concerns among US government scientists over Pentagon funding for the firm, though funding resumed following a review. In November, the US Department of Defense further awarded MP aninvestment agreement to establish domestic processing capabilities. While investorsappear to have taken the Pentagon’s funding for MP as a national vote ofconfidence—the company’s shares have more than doubled since listing in NewYork in November—others fear the US is being outflanked by China. After all,Shenghe describes its ownership as mixed—that is, partially state-owned. It has close ties with the Chinese government: its largest shareholder is a research institute within the government-owned China Geological Survey, which sits directly under the ministry of natural resources. It is also affiliated with the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco), one of the six major state-owned firms that dominate the domestic rare earths industry. A Chinalco representative sit on Shenghe’s board of directors, and according toChinese stock analysts (link in Chinese), Chinalco is involved in Shenghe’s production, operation and strategic decision-making.Some rare earthsanalysts warn China’s latest moves to more closely regulate rare earth productionand exports are part of the country’s longer-term bid to offshore mining andprocessing—the lowest value and most environmentally damaging parts of rareearths production—so as to maximize development of the lucrative downstreamsector to manufacture high-tech products that require rare earth inputs. Farfrom helping restore American rare earth capabilities, Shenghe’s involvement inMP maintains and even heightens US vulnerability, said James Kennedy,president of rare earth advisory Three Consulting.As crazy as itsounds, the Pentagon is using US defense funding to prop up rare earth resourcesuppliers who then feed China’s monopoly, Kennedy said, adding that thePentagon has committed the US to being a low-value supplier into China’s high-valuerare earth metal and magnet monopoly.Matt Sloustcher,senior vice president of communications for MP, said [t]he insinuation that MPMaterials is being ‘propped-up’ by U.S. government funding is false,defamatory, and absurd. He added that the company, as the only US entityproducing rare earth materials at scale today…is the only viable path torapidly restoring the full domestic supply chain to the US.Win-win. But who wins more?Beyond the US,Shenghe since 2016 has had a roughly 10% stake in Greenland Minerals,an Australian company developing a major rare earths mine in Greenland. TheKvanefjeld mine, according to Greenland Minerals, has the potential to becomethe most significant western world producer of rare earths, and possibly atsome of the lowest costs globally (pdf), too.It’s undoubtedlyan attractive prospect—so much so that it may have motivated former USpresident Donald Trump’s suggestion that Washington shouldbuy Greenland.Shenghe describesits investment in the Greenland project as a win-win situation: the firmneeds support from global industry, its chairman said (pdf)at a trade conference held in Copenhagen in 2019, and scoured dozens ofrare earths projects around the world before settling on the Kvanefjeldproject. Meanwhile, just as Shenghe offered its technical expertise to MP’sMountain Pass project, it brings full rare earth value chain proficiency tothe Kvanefjeld project, Greenland Minerals notes in its latest quarterlyreport.In anotherindication of Shenghe’s close ties with the Chinese state, and how foreigncompanies’ tie-ups with Shenghe can end up serving China’s economic goals,Shenghe in 2019 announced (pdf) that it was partnering directly with the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), one of the country’s largest nuclear power producers and last year designated by the US as having ties to the Chinesemilitary. Under the terms of the joint venture, Shenghe and CNNC would import rare earths containing uranium and thorium from Kvanefjeld to China. Uranium and thorium are radioactive byproducts of rare earth processing, and both can be used as nuclear fuel.So when Shengheemphasizes its win-win approach to foreign investments, it raises thequestion: who wins more?Kennedy, theconsultant, wagers it’s China.China’sbrilliance is they just move their monopoly, he said. Instead of monopolizingevery part of the value chain, they just slide their fulcrum to the criticalpoint, which in this case is the rare earth metals, alloys, and magnets thatare crucial for producing high-tech products.The far lesslucrative and much more polluting mining sector is outsourced abroad, and Chinathen partners with countries and firms that become their suppliers.",51234379

6.6738492e+17,spiderman14,WHK Fundamentals,"Originally posted by hillbilly1: ↑DHS Announces Steps to Advance Presidents Commitment to Elevate CybersecurityWASHINGTON – Today, Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas announced the many ways the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will carry out President Biden’s vision to elevate cybersecurity across the government. DHS will lead efforts to mitigate risks to the United States, further strengthen its partnerships with the private sector, and expand its investment in the infrastructure and people required to defend against malicious cyber attacks as part of a whole-of-government effort. Cybersecurity is more important than ever, and we will build on the Department’s excellent work as we transform our whole-of-government approach to tackle the challenge we face as a nation, said Secretary Mayorkas. This week is just the beginning of a series of actions DHS will pursue nationally and internationally to improve cybersecurity at all levels.DHS plays a key role in protecting the American people from threats in cyberspace. The Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is charged with securing Federal civilian government networks and our nation’s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. Congress, in the recent National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), further empowered CISA to execute this mission, including by providing authorities for CISA to hunt for cyber threats in federal agency networks and to more effectively identify vulnerable technologies used by critical infrastructure sectors. Over the past months, CISA has honed its capabilities and furthered the Department’s effort to advance national cybersecurity by: Leading the national effort to secure the 2020 election, including by sharing timely cybersecurity information with state and local election officials; Driving urgent remediation of risks posed by the exploitation of commonly used network management software and providing incident response assistance to compromised entities; Collaborating with government and private sector partners to disrupt and help protect against malicious activity perpetrated by North Korean actors against financial institutions, including the distribution of technical alerts to help network defenders protect against these threats; Issuing a directive to federal agencies requiring implementation of vulnerability disclosure programs, which allow security researchers to proactively identify weaknesses in government websites and applications; and Facilitating shared cybersecurity services that can be used by federal civilian agencies and SLTT governments to rapidly improve cybersecurity capabilities.Through the U.S. Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration, DHS plays a crucial role in increasing cybersecurity across the transportation sector, from aviation and rail to maritime and pipelines. The U.S. Secret Service and ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations combat 21st century crimes, many of which are cyber-enabled. For example, in 2020 alone, the Secret Service responded to 539 network intrusions, arrested over 1,000 people for cyber-financial crimes, and seized over $140 million in assets. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) and CISA recently announced the inaugural research and development awards for the newly launched Secure and Resilient Mobile Network Infrastructure project.DHS will continue to build on these achievements. This week, Secretary Mayorkas will increase the required minimum spend on cybersecurity through FEMA grant awards. To accelerate critical improvements in state and local cybersecurity, CISA will urgently evaluate and implement additional capabilities including potential new grant programs that will enable critical security investments. This is important: the nation’s cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest link. On Thursday, Secretary Mayorkas will speak at the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition and issue a call to action to build a diverse cybersecurity workforce and leverage DHS’s partnerships to tackle the growing risk from ransomware.Ransomware is a cyber pandemic that paralyzes cities, companies, and hospitals across the country. In October, CISA together with other government agencies warned of the growing threat of ransomware targeting the healthcare and public health sector. Previous incidents illustrate the risk ransomware poses to COVID-19 vaccine deployment efforts. Tackling ransomware will require partnering with private organizations, state, local, tribal, and territorial entities -- the hallmark of DHS’s approach to cybersecurity.Secretary Mayorkas will reinforce CISA’s new Reduce the Risk of Ransomware Campaign to encourage public and private sector organizations to take action to mitigate ransomware risk. DHS will also leverage the U.S. Secret Service, through its Cyber Fraud Task Forces, to respond to ransomware incidents and arrest those that engage in this criminal activity. Secretary Mayorkas is slated to participate in several additional engagements in the coming weeks to further highlight how the Department can and will best support its partners in efforts to improve risk management and cybersecurity. The Secretary will also engage with his foreign counterparts to strengthen international cybersecurity collaboration.The DHS workforce is committed to implementing President Biden’s vision of a more cybersecure America.ExpandI like how they blame North Korean actors behind the cyber attacks. We all know who is really behind North Korea ,they were always just a proxy and Biden could never spell that out clearly in case he offends.In any case if this means more contracts to WHK Biden can blame whoever he wants.",51234292

A lot were burnt when it went down again as hype trains do. This is not a hype train. Jatcorp is way undervalued now IMO and ready for a rerate.

I embedded it down below to make it easier to watch for others.My take on Energylink3 is that the Magnis/C4V owned Imperium3 New York cell mfg facility will supply cells directly to EL3 as 1 of the 10 customers already commited for offtakes. EL3 would then assemble those cells into battery packs and storage modules/units in a separate Maryland factory that they own. Im thinking the separate factory for pack assembly is around meeting the security and compliance requirements for supplying equipment to the department of defence. I imagine Magnis would own a small portion of EL3 indirectly due to the 10% ownership in C4V?However they have it setup its great to see the exact cells we will be manufacturing later this year already in use in Martacs products and these future products for the DoD. Possibly even into the electric aircraft with BAE with 6min charge as that other article tonight suggests.Exciting times for Magnis and the Imperium3 consortium.

But this but I will be holding a long term parcel as the upside is massive. Don’t take my word for this but I think this will easily cross 3c this morning. Social media all over it.ExpandIf you want you can ground that with FA, weeks/months could see sufficient deals to justify, IMO, a SP of 10c (approximate MC of $220mil, although I think this is before part paid dilution). If there is dilution required to raise an equity component to establish the potential partnership (announced yesterday) hopefully we would have enough news prior to minimise said dilution. Everything between now and then comes down to perceived probability of deals and their estimated size, this can be distorted by sentiment (hype) and based on supply/demand (wider market awareness/demand and stickiness of holders). Yes it may get to a point where market expectation outweighs probability, however if probability changes (i.e. an actual deal comes through) before sentiment changes again, then there would not be another chance to get in. Every investor needs to assess their own risk/reward estimates amd tolerance to make their own decisions.All IMO, please DYOR amd GLTAH.",51234182

Either you are not holding anymore, or you simply dont trust yourself anymore. Not that analysts were any better in their predictions with respect to TSLA.. they were just as wrong, but I bet they at least acknowledge global warming.Take home message? Analysts can be wrong either way, they often/always lack vision and sentiment in their thinking (naturally, that is hard to put numbers on and the analysis is simply numbers largely generated by a computer).

Many also know what a total joke UURAF is and to a lesser degree MP is yet on a % basis they are both up much more than Lynas So even if you do not believe that Lynas is speculation how can you explain these two?

Using this metric I sold all my NVDA and Bought APTV about 5 months ago, Since then guess I was wrong because NVDA is up 13%. I am still happy APTV is up 83%.

Also, majority of BNPL are consumer focus - where Smartfunding is small business - bigger risk - the only positive factor is the peer-to-peer side. It offsets risk as using other people’s money, but they will have to give a bigger slice of the profit back to the investor. So making a lot less profit.

6.6738426e+17,Figaro,Why arent we a $500m MC company yet?,"The NPV calculation takes into account the capital cost of the mine and the plant - A$73m in the 2019 DFS. Therefore the NPV does not grow linearly with additional tonnage mined - its better than that.Conversely, though, if the additional tonnage is used to extend mine life, then those later years make a smaller contribution to the NPV because future cash flows are discounted. At the discount rate of 10% used in the DFS, $1m of cash flow in Year 5 is only worth $590K.Also worth noting are the expected spod prices used in the original DFS: US$687 over the life of mine, at an exchange rate of 0.70. The revised DFS will surely have to use a lower spod price - its currently around US$500, though rising - and a less favourable exchange rate. Remember, the whole reason the DFS was delayed from last year was to allow spod pricing to recover.Given the above, I think an NPV of $300m is a tad optimistic for the current resource.Figaro",51234032

The Crown deposit in the northern part of the complex has an indicated and inferred resource of 37.7 Mt @ 1.07% Nb2 O5 , 1.16% total lanthanide oxides, 0.09% Y2 O3 , 0.3% ZrO, 0.024% Ta2 O5 , and 7.99% P2 O5 (as of January, 2010), while phosphorous mineralisation in the Swan deposit in the northern half of the complex has an indicated and inferred resource of 77 Mt @ 13.5% phosphorous oxide (MiningNewsPremium.net, 16th March 2011). The Anchor deposit in the southwest of the Mount Weld complex contains niobium-tantalum mineralisation.refer to page 78.Deposit Type 3.7: Rare-earth elements associated with phosphorites General description: Elevated levels of REE are reported to be associated with deposits of phosphorites in Australia and overseas. Australian deposits: Korella, Sherrin Creek, D Tree, and Wonnarah (all Georgina Basin, Qld and NT: Fig. 3.17). Deposits outside Australia: Schevchenko, Kazakhstan (Will et al., 1995); Abu Tartar, Egypt (Hussein and El Sharkawi, 1990); Zhijin, China (Li et al., 2007). Type example in Australia: Korella, Queensland (Figs 3.17 and 3.18).Deposit Type 3.1: Rare-earth-element-bearing laterite associated with carbonatite complexes General description: Carbonatites are igneous rocks composed of more than 50% carbonate minerals, often spatially and temporally associated with alkaline felsic magmas, and have somewhat contentious origins. Primary carbonatites consist mainly of calcitic (sövite) and/or dolomitic (rauhaugite) rock types. Carbonate-rich melts can extract incompatible elements (e.g., REE, zirconium, niobium, phosphorus) from coexisting silicate melts or solids, concentrating them for subsequent deposition of rare-element cumulates from the carbonate magma (Mungall, 2007). Carbonatite complexes have generated considerable exploration interest in Australia because of their potential to host significant resources of REE, copper, niobium, tantalum, phosphorus, and uranium. Such intrusions occur near major structural features throughout the cratonic blocks and they range in age from Paleoproterozoic to Jurassic (Jaques, 2008). The largest deposits in Australia (Mount Weld, Cummins Range) formed from the supergene enrichment of REE in the laterite profile above large composite carbonatite bodies that are generally of Proterozoic age. Deeply weathered carbonatites also occur in Brazil, Canada, Finland, Guyana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire (see references in Lottermoser and England, 1988). In contrast to such world-class REE deposits as Mountain Pass in California, few Australian occurrences contain significant abundances of REE in the primary zones of carbonatite. Possible exceptions to this include two mineralised examples in Western Australia, namely Ponton Creek (see Appendix 7) and Yangibana (see Deposit Type 3.10 template). Australian deposits/prospects: Mount Weld (Yilgarn Craton, WA); Cummins Range (near junction of Halls Creek and King Leopold orogens, Western Australia). Deposits outside Australia: Araxá, Catalão, Goias, Minas Gerais, and Tapira (all Brazil); Mabounié (Disallowedon); Mrima (Kenya); Lueshe (Zaire); Dorowa and Shawa (Zimbabwe): Christie et al. (1998) and Lottermoser (1994).Note dorowa is flagged in the PSC announcement as nearby with infrastructure and in production.Note: Has yet to be assessed for REE potential.https://www.investegate.co.uk/ArticlePrint.aspx?id=20100611100000H3277dated in 2010, looks like this project belonged to someone from ACR. Or atleast they owned a project in the same area.The Project complements ACRs Chishanya Hill phosphate project in Zimbabwe,where considerable expertise has already been developed, investigating thegeology and metallurgy of a similar carbonatite intrusion. https://www.vastplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/annual_report_2012.pdfannual report from ACR.. The science we apply continues to yield results on recovery rates of phosphate concentrates from our Chishanya Phosphate project in Zimbabwe. Once the final report is fully evaluated, we will be defining a budget forthe fullresource definition and scoping study forthis highgrade carbonatite.More infohttp://www.geologicalsociety.org.zw/sites/default/files/documents/GSZ NL Feb 2010.pdfExploration of the Chishanya Carbonatite was the subject of the next presentation by Tim Holmes for Martin Spence of African Consolidated Resources. African carbonatites associated with rifting tend to be rich in CaO, whereas those within the cratons are dominated by Mg carbonates. These are derived from partial melts of the mantle and were extrusive, the well-known Ol Donyo Lengai volcano being a modern example. These volcanic plugs are important sources of apatite for fertilizer, Nb and other rare earth minerals as well as Cu.

Im still struggling to find some of the raw drill data regarding phosphate content, but seems in line with other decent carbonatite like deposits.just for a lot of my followers whom are rare earth investors, this is just one of their projects which has had no attention really. Their Flagship Arcadia lithium/petalite project is what i am invested. I have only just realised the REO potential at chishanya.SF2THExpandbumping this post.Expecting results in the next month or so relating to the soil sampling program as chishanya. Im quietly confident that this carbonatite dyke is highly prosperous for rare earth minerisation. Apatite rich ferrosovite Mt Weld carbonatite complex of Western Australia intrudes an Archean greenstone sequence dominated by basic and ultrabasic metamorphosed igneous rocks. Carbonatites form the core of the complex and are surrounded by glimmerites. The dominant carbonatite is sövite and is intruded by rauhaugites and carbonate-rich veins. The present investigation examines the mineral chemistry and petrology of the layered rauhaugites. They are essentially composed of ferroan dolomite, mica, magnetite and apatite,Phosphorus grades and underlying geology is similar to Mt Weld. Soil sampling is good first step to test for lathanides and other rare earths but utlimately would like to see a small drill program put in place the intercept the dyke Lynas Mt weld below.",51233879

This is a clear and distinct advantage to the Anteotech test. Don’t be fooled by these claims of 97% sensitivity. That’s a 97% sensitivity in the range 5-12 days(usually only with symptoms) while the Anteotech test is going to be testing from about day 2-3 all the way until about day 18. It’s very important to understand the LLOD and how that relates to the published sensitivity. Anteotech might publish a sensitivity of 97% however it will be a much superior test because of the LLOD and the ability to test for the virus earlier in the incubation stage before symptoms.

The arguments for Bitcoin can be made for any number of the other coins too.Ultimately fiat currency will retain its value so long as the government requires you to pay taxes.Cryptocurrencies are simply acting as a inflationary hedge.Difference when compared to gold is that Gold has a tangible use therefore it has a real value.Bitcoin cannot be usable as a stable method of payment while it is also being used as a inflationary hedge.If you are buying today and it happens to be the top the previous top had a sharp 50% drop before it found a bottom. Gold will not nuke down to $0 but Bitcoin could. However, overtime its not much different to holding cash. Having a portion of your portfolio in Gold is probably preferable to holding cash right now, unless your risk tolerance for volatility is much higher in which case punt away on Bitcoin.It is far more logical to me for governments to issue their own crypto currency with a limited supply and permit it to be traded like fiat currency. That - will have long term asset value. ExpandI think all of us would be happy if we rode the Bitcoin train during the last few years. I remember vividly when it overtook gold. It would have been nice to enjoy a 50 bagger investment. However, my sentiments at that time remain. The Bitcoin enthusiasts can rightly point to their gains and that unlike money, it is not subject to continuous printing, but the lack of tangible attributes, and the extreme volatility have always kept crypto currencies out of my life. I sleep much better at night attempting to 2-3 bag a gold stock, or in the case of RRL, having the company fully funding my living expenses by the generous dividend yield.With the POG heading upwards we will move closer to a $3.50 SP pretty rapidly.",51233830

6.673839e+17,Verily1,WSB/potentIal PM sQuEEze,"Originally posted by Moonwalker101: ↑Just imagine what kind of impact something like this would have on gold and silver if this actually succeeds in just ONE state. The symbolism alone would set fire to gold and silver prices.Kansas Bill Would Make Gold and Silver Legal Tender in the StateFEBRUARY 21, 2021 BYMICHAEL MAHARREY 0 0A bill introduced in the Kansas House would recognize gold and silver specie as legal tender and repeal all taxes levied on it. The legislation would pave the way for Kansans to use gold and silver in everyday transactions, a foundational step for the people to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.The Federal Reserve is the engine that drives the most powerful government in the history of the world. Ron Paul popularized the slogan End the Fed, but Congress is nowhere near abolishing the central bank. It can’t even come up with the will to audit the Fed.Even though state action can’t end the Fed, there are steps states can take that will undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money. By passing laws that encourage and incentivize the use of gold and silver in daily transactions by the general public, policy changes at the state level such as the Kansas Legal Tender Act has the potential to create a wide-reaching impact and set the foundation to nullify the Fed’s monopoly power over the monetary system.A coalition of four Republicans introduced House Bill 2123 (HB2123) on Jan. 25. The legislation would make gold and silver legal tender in the state, recognizing it as a medium of exchange for the payment of debts and taxes. In effect, gold and silver specie would be treated as money, putting it on par with Federal Reserve notes in Kansas.Under the proposed law, Legal tender means a recognized medium of exchange for the payment of debts and taxes. Specie legal tender would be defined as:By allowing the court to designate additional specie to be used as legal tender, Kansas could free its citizens from potential supply constraints imposed by the use of only United States minted gold and silver coin. More importantly, the people of the state of Kansas would be able to define what specie is considered constitutional tender, further distancing themselves from potential control of their competing currency by Washington D.C.Practically speaking, the passage of HB2123 would allow residents to use gold or silver coins to pay taxes and other debts owed to the state. In effect, it would put gold and silver on the same footing as Federal Reserve notes.HB2123 would also repeal property and capital gains taxes on gold and silver.Passage of this bill would build ona foundation set in 2019 when Kansas repealed the sales tax on gold and silver.Kansas could become the fourth state to recognize gold and silver as legal tender. Utah led the way, reestablishing constitutional money in 2011. Wyoming and Oklahoma have since joined.KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERSTaxes on gold and silver erect barriers to using gold and silver as money by raising transaction costs. HB2123 would exempt gold and silver bullion from state capital gains taxes. Passage of this legislation would eliminate a barrier to investing in gold and silver. It would also make it more practical to gold and silver in everyday transactions, a foundational step for people to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.In effect, states that collect taxes on purchases of precious metals act as if gold and silver aren’t money at all.Imagine if you asked a grocery clerk to break a $5 bill and he charged you a 35 cent tax. Silly, right? After all, you were only exchanging one form of money for another. But that’s essentially what South Carolina’s capital gains tax on gold and silver bullion does. By eliminating this tax on the exchange of gold and silver, South Carolina would treat specie as money instead of a commodity. This represents a small step toward reestablishing gold and silver as legal tender and breaking down the Fed’s monopoly on money.We ought not to tax money – and that’s a good idea. It makes no sense to tax money, former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul said during testimony in support an Arizona bill that repealed capital gains taxes on gold and silver in that state. Paper is not money, it’s fraud, he continued.LEGALIZING THE CONSTITUTIONPassage of HB2123 would effectively legalize the US Constitution in Kansas.The United States Constitution states in Article I, Section 10, No State shall…make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts. Currently, all debts and taxes in South Carolina are either paid with Federal Reserve Notes (dollars) which were authorized as legal tender by Congress or with coins issued by the US Treasury — very few of which have gold or silver in them.The Federal Reserve destroys this constitutional monetary system by creating a monopoly based on its fiat currency. Without the backing of gold or silver, the central bank can easily create money out of thin air. This not only devalues your purchasing power over time; it also allows the federal government to borrow and spend far beyond what would be possible in a sound money system. Without the Fed, the US government wouldn’t be able to maintain all of its unconstitutional wars and programs.Passage of HB2123 would reestablish gold and silver as legal tender in the state and take a step toward that constitutional requirement, ignored for decades in every state.It would also begin the process of abolishing the Federal Reserve system by attacking it from the bottom up – pulling the rug out from under it by working to make its functions irrelevant at the state and local levels, and setting the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve monopoly by introducing competition into the monetary system.Constitutional tender expert Professor William Greene said when people in multiple states actually start using gold and silver instead of Federal Reserve Notes, it would effectively nullify the Federal Reserve and end the federal government’s monopoly on money.Once things get to that point, Federal Reserve notes would become largely unwanted and irrelevant for ordinary people. Nullifying the Fed on a state-by-state level is what will get us there.Get Peter Schiff’s key gold headlines in your inbox every week – click here – for a free subscription to his exclusive weekly email updates.Interested in learning how to buy gold and buy silver?Call 1-888-GOLD-160 and speak with a Precious Metals Specialist today!Federal Reserve,gold,Kansas,silver,sound moneyExpandGood post @Moonwalker101 If you look back a few years you will see that one state after another has done this in the USA.

6.6738348e+17,goldbear77,Huge potential for RMD in this cycle,@Crom Valen - if you can run the ruler then you should know the answer to thatbecause silver is a notoriously fickle beast - and Maranon is 500m deepboards are never as sharp - or at least most boards cannot be as sharp as say I am as an individual investor who can make individual small capital outlays around daily or weeky technicals to time my run. we are only just emerging from a 10 year bear market in which small companies struggled to raise any money at all without huge dilutionso they will not plan capex spend on deep drilling a Silver deposit until they actually know silver prices will support the project being seen as viabletheres a reason RDM has so few shares on issue after so long listed - the board is very penny conscious - which shows experience - because every driller with grey hairs know its all cyclical Silver hasnt even proven it can sustainably break and hold above $us30 yetas an individual investor Im certain it will happen. and am positioned into RDM accordinglyBut a board cant allocate scarce funds like that until it actually occurs. They will not punt - like an individual investors. Some do actually - but RDM is still standing with a good track record of making every dollar count because they dont puntso they chase near surface very reliably demanded metals. copper is typically a favourite - there are always funds whole give you value if you find near surface copperAs i said the other day - RDM has too many projects. But I think they realise that its smarter to keep all the projects and then farm them out for %s as overall commodity cycle re-inflates - than sell a few so they can focus on Maranon for egtrue - they arent as sharp as Tony McClure. Tony is in a league of his own in understanding both mining and the metal market and timing expenditure accordinglybut SVL dont really play the value by drill discovery game that RDM specialises inBut like I also said the other day - when market starts thinking US30silver price isnt a maybe - but actually becomes the technical bedrock bottom for silver - money will come for Maranonwhen the ceo and board see that shift - I think youll find prioritisation decisions shiftultimately I expect theyll want to SP to inflate substantially - do a modest CR - then run another few deep DD holes,51233561

Stock went as low as $0.05 and they ended up doing a 10 for one consolidation of shares because they had issued so many. So, the $6.35 is post consolidation - pre consolidation this would be $0.635. If you bought where I originally did at $1.95, youd be waiting for this to go to $19.50 before you are back in the money. Only reason Lynas is now going up is because they are getting out of Malaysia. Building a plant in WA and have an agreement in USA.Saying that, Lynas is a completely different sector to IOU.

Thumping global growth expectations and tightening supply have elevated the price of copper to a nine-year high and lifted the Australian dollar above US79¢ for the first time in three years.The rally in the price of the metal, sometimes called Dr Copper for its economy-predicting properties, was shadowed by a sell-off in the bond market that caused Australia’s 10-year bond yield to rise above 1.5 per cent for the first time in two years.Copper futures traded in Asia advanced 5.9 per cent to 67,150 yuan a tonne after LME copper on Friday broke through $US9000, a level unseen since 2011 when the European debt crisis was raging.ASX copper stocks were in high demand on Monday, led by copper-gold producer Sandfire Resources, up 8.5 per cent to $5.61, and OZ Minerals, up 7 per cent to $22.63.Theres no significant new developments around, and were talking about millions of tonnes of copper in shortfall, said Dennis Wood, the chairman of ASX junior copper explorer KGL Resources, which is hitting up investors for $24 million to fund its Northern Territory Jervois copper project.The copper price had been pretty much stable for 10 years and there was very little exploration done because the big producers, particularly in South America, were producing it quite cheaply for a long time.Operating costs are going up and grades are dropping.Copper is essential, you can’t fire electricity around without copper.Mr Wood estimates global production at the moment is in the low 20 million range. It doesn’t matter what you look at in green technology, it needs more copper.The electric vehicle thematic has been a huge boost to copper this time around, because EVs use more significantly more copper than standard vehicles with internal combustion engines, from the wiring to battery charging infrastructure.https://www.copyright link/markets/debt-markets/growth-pulse-sends-copper-price-to-nine-year-high-20210222-p574or",51233384

It is taken as read that your credit history is good, unless there are bad things listed on your credit file. A credit score is a new thing and a different beast. Credit providers are required to report all credit activities - the date an account was opened, the nature and amount of credit approved, then on a monthly basis whether payments were on time or late (using a traffic light system). A series of logarithms assigns points to a credit score which is predicated on activity (is: applications) as payments (obviously late payments are bad). The higher the score, technically the more creditworthy you are, but in reality a low score rings alarm bells and leaves the person unable to access reasonably priced credit. BNPL activity impacts a credit score, but can also render a person unable to access a loan if unable to meet repayment affordability requirements.",51233375

It’s a pretty standard process, you appoint a Merchant bank, you have a data room, the merchant bank approaches all sorts of people, people approach you as they already have. You set up a timetable with non binding indicative offers, go thru a short list, then what to do strategically, then there’ll be a bit of tension between the demerger process and that. And depending on which one looks better, or whether you can do them in parallel? I don’t know yet, lets go out there & do some price & value discovery guys eh, lets find out what this is really worth to people. My take on that, is the Merchant bank is not there to organise finance, but more to act like an auctioneer to get the best offers possible for Goulamina. He talks of tension between the demerger process and the non binding indicative offers. I take that as meaning if the offer was good enough theyd just sell the whole thing without demerging. His comment And depending on which one looks better, or whether you can do them in parallel tends to support that scenario. Of course thats just one scenario, with the demerger + partnership scenario theyd try to get the best balance in that as possible.Interestingly he talks of offers, inferring partnership or outright ownership offers as opposed to offtakes. Offtakes are important to obtain project finance, however I see this whole process as either an outright sale or a partnership whereby the partner buys a percentage of the project and those funds are used to develop the project. Heaps of different scenarios out there, that is the job of the merchant bank to explore.As someone suggested, this threat (if you want to call it that) of bringing in a merchant bank to auction off all or part of Goulamina, might just incite an offer too good to refuse. After all, this is the 5th biggest Lithium deposit in the World, the resource is open to expansion and is the biggest deposit in the World that is on the market.ExpandI agree. This is a multi layered process and the Merchant Bank facilitates it all coming together. They recommend a partner, assist with finding a way to finance CAPEX, working capital, work out Spin off details and help sort out Tax etc.It may or may not mean we will get a chance to buy more shares.",51233125

Having said that, natural gas field production wont fall over a cliff tomorrow. Natural gas remains a major fuel source. Indeed some gas fields will probably stay alive for a long time as backup for instances of renewables failures.interestingly, Barkshire Hathaway recently bought into gas production? so the future for natural gas is not clear cut at this time.Im repeating myself here, but its my major sticking point with EMP that none of the big gas players have taken a serious interest in it.Thats it from me today - thanks for post.Expandnone of the big gas players have taken a serious interestnot so, however, your concern is valid...back when EMP opened the doors to potential partners, there were about 5 lookers apparently.Back then, it was assumed Exxon would be a prime candidate, but since then it seems they have other issues, including trying to exit Australia.... Potential front runners?Beach...my first choice, they have experience and data in Bass Strait, and are now enjoying success in the Otway.Cooper, and Seven West...existing players nearby, with Seven having a small operation and maybe looking to bulk up?An overseas mob was in there too.....i notice someone here mentioned Japan and South Korea....they dont figure in my thoughts, but you certainly couldnt rule it out...There was speculation of an investment group keen on a minor, silent JV partnership....So....whats happened?......first of all, Covid canned everything, all the O&G companies went into limp mode and wouldnt look an any expenditure....Then we reached a point where it would be reasonable to assume that no one would bid with the threat of the end of tenement terms, or expiry........thats now been resolved, with a 30 month extension, thereby showing certainty of title, a huge boost.........we are now awaiting for the 3D data, and no doubt, all interested parties would want to see that before making a final decision....also, any acquisition of nearby tenements would enlarge the project boundaries....Its excruciatingly slow, and, we have no idea when a firm proposal will hit the table, given the DD required by suitors prior to signing a cheque. There would be a mix of wanting to hold out as long as possible, to not wanting to be outbid..........these mobs wont move fast on a big commitment so its unreasonable to expect a wild bid to be thrown out without careful consideration. Given the imminent arrival of 3D data, and the lead times required to commit to drilling etc, then the time is rapidly approaching, and though im confident of a bid eventually, one must be prepared for a lowball offer that could back us into a corner, or, even worse....We are a spec stock, with all the inherent risks, however, in our favour is we already have an asset, a low MC ( around 6M, compared to some with an MC of over 60M who are venturing into unproven, widcat territory).....a market adage from years ago says we are not a stock for mothers and orphans......

Millions and millions of dollars has been made available both from Governments and the private sector as a vaccine for COVID-19 and would be far more lucrative than than a vaccine for MERS but I am sure the countries that were affected by MERS allocated funding for vaccine research just no where near as much as available for COVID-19.and finally the reason you do not lock down for the flue is:More infectious: people with covid on average spread it to 2-2.5 other people where as flu is only 1.4 people (10 transfers of flue leads to 30 people infected with covid this number is 1,024).

6.6738168e+17,$tock1,Ann: Macquarie Group provides update to short-term outlook,"DJ Texas Blackout Boosts Australian Bank by Up to $215 Million -- UpdateDJ Texas Blackout Boosts Australian Bank by Up to $215 Million -- Update By Joe Wallace and Ryan Dezember The deep freeze that plunged millions of Texans into darkness is rippling through energy markets in unexpected ways, producing a financial windfall for an Australian bank and severe pain for other companies caught up in the disruption. The extreme weather froze wind turbines and oil-and-gas wells, closed oil refiners and prompted power stations to trip offline, sending a jolt through energy markets. Wholesale power prices rocketed, as did spot prices for natural gas in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas. The turbulence led to a bonanza for commodity traders at Australias Macquarie Group Ltd., whose ability to funnel gas and electricity around the country enabled them to capitalize on soaring demand and prices in states such as Texas. The bank bumped up its guidance Monday for earnings in the year through March to reflect the windfall. It said that net profit after tax would be 5% to 10% higher than in the 2020 fiscal year. That equates to an increase of up to 273.1 million Australian dollars, equivalent to around $215 million. In its previous guidance, issued Feb. 9, Macquarie said it expected profits to be slightly down on 2020. Extreme winter weather conditions in North America have significantly increased short-term client demand for Macquaries capabilities in maintaining critical physical supply across the commodity complex, and particularly in relation to gas and power, the bank said. Macquaries windfall shows how big profits can be made wagering on relative scarcity of natural gas in a country awash in the fuel. The U.S. shale-drilling boom unleashed so much gas over the past decade that prices have been depressed to the point that producers with gushers have gone bankrupt. Yet gas buyers, such as power plants and manufacturers, are routinely left paying surging prices when demand peaks during winter storms. Behind such instances of energy feast and famine is a gas infrastructure system that has failed to keep up with all the drilling. Pipelines laid decades before the shale boom are often in the wrong places, or too small to meet todays demand. Having space reserved on certain pipelines can become incredibly lucrative when uncharacteristic weather causes swells in demand. Scarcity in Texas and the Great Plains was amplified last week when temperatures dropped low enough to freeze shut many of the regions gas wells and other energy infrastructure. Capacity on pipelines into the region became precious. Traders and energy firms that had paid in advance for the right to use these supply routes were suddenly in position to rake in huge profits as utilities vied for fuel deliveries. Macquarie describes itself as the second-largest marketer of physical gas in North America behind BP PLC, with a team in Houston and access to 80% of pipelines spanning the U.S., according to a person familiar with the matter. The business, which Macquarie has built out for over a decade, received a boost from the acquisition of Cargill Inc.s North America power and gas division in 2017. The Australian bank rents access to natural-gas pipelines and electricity networks across the U.S., enabling it to profit when prices in some regions are significantly higher than in others and when consumers are in urgent need of fuel or power. That was the case last week, when frozen energy infrastructure and the closure of oil-and-gas wells set off a race for natural gas among Texas power plants and other consumers. Macquarie sent large volumes of gas from the north of the U.S. to the south, where the cold weather sent prices soaring last week, the person familiar with the matter said. It supplied electricity in Texas as well as gas to generate electrical power. At one point, natural gas changed hands for more than $900 per million British thermal units at the ONEOK Gas Transportation hub in Oklahoma, according to commodities data provider S&P Global Platts. By Friday, prices at the hub had fallen back to about $14 per million British thermal units. That was still comparatively high: Benchmark futures for U.S. natural gas, which are tied to delivery at Henry Hub in Louisiana, have generally cost between $2.50 and $3.50 per million British thermal units in recent months. Shares of Macquarie rose 3.4% in Sydney on Monday after the company raised its profit outlook. They are now down 2.8% over the past 12 months. Macquarie last year provided an undisclosed amount of investment capital to upstart Houston-based utility Griddy Energy LLC, whose business model is to pass variable wholesale electricity prices through to customers. Griddy customers complained of paying lofty sums when power prices shot up to thousands of dollars per megawatt hour last week, according to local Texas media reports. A Griddy spokesperson said an order by the state utility agency to the operator of the electricity grid to make market prices reflect the scarcity of power pushed up prices for its customers. On Feb. 12, the company started emailing and texting customers to say they might be better off switching providers for a short time to avoid exposure to wholesale prices, she said. Corporate casualties from the freeze are also starting to emerge. Just Energy Group Inc., a Canada-based energy supplier, on Monday said it faced a financial hit of about $250 million, in part from buying electricity at sky-high prices in Texas during the cold blast. The company, which said its ability to stay in business was in jeopardy, saw its shares slump 30%. In another instance, shares of Atmos Energy Corp. fell 5.1% Monday after the Dallas-based gas supplier said it would have to pay between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion for gas it bought at elevated prices in Texas, Colorado and Kansas. Atmos may issue stock or raise debt to help to pay for the purchases, it said Friday. German energy company RWE AG said its 2021 earnings would be hit by outages at the companys wind turbines, as well as from high prices for electricity.

The most-traded SHFE 2104 copper contract rose by the daily trading limit to 67,370 yuan/mt on Monday February 22, and this was 18.5% higher than the lowest price on February 3.SMM interviewed Xu Maili, deputy director of the Everbright Futures Research Institute, about his views on this surge in copper prices. He thought that the rapid rise in copper prices has broken away from short-term fundamental support as currently supply from copper smelters was stable while demand did not improve out of expectations. In terms of macroeconomic environment, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases was curbed in China, and this, combined with easing global liquidity and economic stimulus packages lifted risk appetite.

This is a clear and distinct advantage to the Anteotech test. Don’t be fooled by these claims of 97% sensitivity. That’s a 97% sensitivity in the range 5-12 days(usually only with symptoms) while the Anteotech test is going to be testing from about day 2-3 all the way until about day 18. It’s very important to understand the LLOD and how that relates to the published sensitivity. Anteotech might publish a sensitivity of 97% however it will be a much superior test because of the LLOD and the ability to test for the virus earlier in the incubation stage before symptoms. If you understand this before results are published, it could possibly stop you from making a rash decision when the results are published.

We’re slowly getting the old Raggertooth back with logical breakdowns Had to chuckle at the seed to exit comment too In terms of market cap, I have to admit... I do struggle to see how that’s one of your key reasonings behind the stock dropping. Let’s not get confused, market cap is calculated by multiplying the share price by the total number of outstanding shares. So in essence we’re still talking about what share price is fair value, which seems to be holding firm around the 13-15c mark post the recent selling frenzyI guess the other thing for me is that I don’t see it as emotional investing if I am predicting strong growth in industries in which FFG holds subsidiaries. It’s just an educated guess, right? Let’s look at icandy interactive for example. The mobile gaming industry has gone through the roof since Covid and that popularity isn’t going anywhere soon. Not to mention the rollout of 5G across SE Asia increasing the percentage of population who have access to mobile gaming. Don’t forget the Sky Candy joint venture either! While we’re yet to hear news on their first project, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to predict that it’ll be a cut above what icandy have produced in the pastAlso, I know the comparison to IOU and Afterpay annoys you... it does for me too! However, it’s not emotional to think that the BNPL sector is extremely popular right now! FFG/Smartfunding is carving its own unique place in that sector. And while it’s not going to be an IOU or Afterpay, it still has a lot of upside. It’s the potential of the industry we’re considering. I’m no real estate agent, but if you buy the worst house in an expensive neighbourhood (and FFG is still a pretty good house) it’s still going to be worth a lot of money, even if it’s not the best house. It’s about being in the right neighbourhood at the right time ExpandI agree with you regarding iCandy, however, many assumptions are made by lessor informed about the real positions that FFG holds and are caught up in the emotion based on other stocks in specific categories and assuming that FFG will grow as this stocks have.

6.6738138e+17,JacobW,Strategic partners and offtakers,"Digging into the VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF23 Feb 2021, 03:20GMTThe rush to cleaner energy has bolstered demand for essential metals and minerals, which has powered strong returns in the VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF [REMX].VanEck’s Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF, despite production disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic, has risen 38% so far in 2021 (through 19 February). The fund had a strong performance last year when it opened 2020 at $40.86 before closing at $65.82 on 31 December.The VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF has total net assets of $676m (as of 19 February), and a year-to-date total daily return, according to Yahoo Finance, of 37.3% as of 22 February. Sitting onThe VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF, launched on 27 October 2010, seeks to replicate the performance of the MVIS Global Rare Earth/Strategic Metals Index, which tracks companies involved in producing, refining and recycling rare earth and strategic metals and minerals.These metals and minerals are used in technologies, such as civil and military jet engines, electric vehicles, wind turbines and cellular phones.Of the fund’s 20 listed holdings as of19/2, the most heavily weighted was Shenghe Resources [600392.SS] at 9.84%, followed by Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt [603799.SS] at 9.36 and China Molybdenum [603993.SS] at 8%. Other major holdings included China Northern Rare Earth Group [600111] at 6.93%, Lynas Rare Earths [LYC.AX] at 5.98% and Lithium Americas [LAC] at 5.96%.Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt’s share price has been on a strong run, despite a drop-off in demand from the aerospace sector, where cobalt is used to manufacture jet turbine blades. The continued growth in electric vehicles largely offset these challenges — global sales were up 43% year-on-year in 2020, according to EV-Volumes — where cobalt is a vital component in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries. As of 19 February, the stock was up 33.7% year to date.Shares in Lynas Rare Earths were also up 46.2% year to date (through 22 February). The stock has been climbing since a $30.4m contract from the US Department of Defense was announced in early February to build a Texas facility to process specialised minerals used to make weapons and electronics. Development company Lithium Americas has also benefited from increased demand for electric vehicles. Digging deeperThere are challenges ahead for the industrial sector, such as uncertainty around aerospace demand and growing ethical and environmental concerns around the use of cobalt.Despite these headwinds, fundamentals for continued growth in the ETF are strong, with electric vehicles and wind turbines benefiting from greener government policies under US president Joe Biden.Indeed, Ying Lu, senior analyst at Roskill, expects cobalt demand to double by 2030 due to an increased focus on battery manufacturing, The Northern Minerreported. According to Fortune Business Insights, the lithium market is set to jump from $4bn in 2019 to $8.2bn by 2027. Considering that the US imports 80% of its rare earths from China, according to ETF Trends,Asia is likely to remain the main driver of that predicted growth.However, this could change in the months ahead if China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology goes ahead with threats to limit exports of rare earth minerals, which are crucial for US and European defence contractors. The minerals are needed in the manufacturing of F-35 fighter jets, among other things, according to the Financial Times.The move, yet another avenue in the US-China trade tensions, could backfire on Chinese producers, however, if it forces the US to look at alternative suppliers such as Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths.China’s virtual monopoly in rare earth metals not only gives it a strategic upper hand over heavily dependent countries like the US, Tom Lydon, CEO of ETF Trends, said. But also makes the supply chain anything but reliable.China’s virtual monopoly in rare earth metals not only gives it a strategic upper hand over heavily dependent countries like the US. But also makes the supply chain anything but reliable - Tom Lydon, CEO of ETF Trends An effort to increase production outside of China could flood the market with new material and cause supply to outstrip demand, Harrison Schwartz, head of research at Nairu Capital, wrote in Seeking Alpha.The most profitable and cheapest of the companies in REMX are situated in China. This creates geopolitical risks that could cause a decline in sales or currency volatility which harms REMX, Schwartz considered.However, given the strong market outlook for rare earth and strategic minerals and metals, combined with a potential undervaluation of the companies in the VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF makes Schwartz bullish. He forecasts that the ETF could rise to between $130 and $160. This rally has legs, he concluded.",51232922

GreeneEnergy & Environment Nuclear Energy United States and CanadaUranium highlighted on dark periodic table (klms/Shutterstock)Advanced nuclear power generation technologies that focus on modular construction, factory fabrication, shorter construction times, and passive safety could work in concert with renewable energy to deliver carbon-free electricity that will help meet energy demand while addressing the risk of climate change. There are currently over seventy projects to develop advanced nuclear technologies being pursued in the United States and Canada.Most of these new nuclear technologies are designed to use a more energy-dense fuel than that used by traditional light-water reactors, enabling them to deliver energy out of a smaller facility and operate for longer times between refueling. However, there are no existing facilities to produce this fuel, called high-assay low-enriched uranium or HALEU, in the quantities required to support advanced reactor deployment, which is expected to triple by the middle of this century. The lack of a reliable, long-term source of HALEU is the top concern of advanced reactor developers, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to support HALEU availability.The conundrumTo make sales, reactor developers need to be able to show potential buyers that they will have access to a reliable source of fuel for the life of a new power plant. In addition, building a new plant will require capital to finance construction, and the lack of a demonstrated fuel supply makes the path to adequate financing almost impossible.The US Department of Energy (DOE) has funded an initial demonstration of HALEU production, but that project will only last until 2022 and will produce only a tiny quantity of the fuel.There is no market yet to support the build out of HALEU production sufficient to fuel even a small number of commercially deployed advanced reactors.Potential producers of HALEU need firm off take commitments to raise the capital required to support the construction and operation of new, specialized production capacity. Individual reactor developers are, at best, in the early stages of deploying demonstration or first-of-a-kind units, and are limited in the commitments they can make to potential HALEU producers.In any case, those commitments would be in question, because the prospects for any particular reactor developer are uncertain, even if the prospects for the class of advanced reactors is promising.Furthermore, the initial commitments of one or a handful of reactor developers would likely not reach the volume that would facilitate an economically attractive build out of fuel production capacity.Although reactor developers are desperate to point to an assured supply of HALEU, potential producers do not have an assured source of demand that would enable them to raise capital and deploy it with acceptable risk, a conundrum that threatens the future of advanced nuclear power.How a HALEU bank could resolve the conundrumA HALEU reserve—or, more accurately, a HALEU bank—could provide a mechanism to meet the needs of reactor developers for an assured source of fuel, while addressing the needs of potential fuel producers for a commitment sufficient to support capital investment in production. A bank could commit to purchase a quantity of HALEU over time that would be targeted to meet reasonable potential requirements of an advanced reactor fleet and adequate to satisfy the economics of a HALEU supply chain. The commitments could be made on the basis of a request for proposal—or other solicitation process—designed to provide price discipline to the acquisition.Payments to the HALEU producers would be made on delivery of the output to the bank—limiting the bank’s exposure to cost and operational risks the producers should control—but allowing producers to be paid based on their production timeline and reducing their exposure to timing risk associated with the uncertain deployment of new reactor technologies.Once the volume and price targets are known, the bank could offer subscriptions for the available HALEU to reactor developers, which would provide the assurance of fuel availability at a known price to support potential reactor sales and financing.The bank would likely want a deposit and purchase commitment, or some form of security, to ensure that developers and their customers have a reasonable degree of confidence in their volume and timing requirements; however, full payment for the HALEU fuel would occur at the time of delivery, avoiding further demands on the financial resources of reactor projects.The bank, with a low cost of capital, would manage the timing differences between production and the delivery to operating reactors.The bank could be designed to self-extinguish after its initial quantities are sold off, or it could remain in operation for a designated period of time to preserve liquidity in the HALEU supply. In either case, the funds used for the initial capitalization of the bank would ultimately be returned to the US government.The public interest would be protectedIt is likely that a HALEU bank would need to be funded initially by the US government, perhaps through the Department of Energy, to catalyze the production of HALEU and support the development of advanced reactors.Such funding would be consistent with DOE’s other support for advanced nuclear energy technologies, including the Advanced Reactor Development Program. But the government’s risks associated with capitalizing the bank would be limited.Funding for the bank would not be in the form of a grant. The bank’s funds would not be committed until fuel was delivered, limiting the risk of acquisition. The initial outlay would be recovered through future sales of HALEU.While some of the subscriptions ultimately might not convert into purchases by reactor operators, the bank would be reasonably protected from being left with HALEU that it could be unable to sell.First, even if the specific developers entering into initial subscriptions do not make purchases, the bank would have the flexibility to sell the unclaimed quantities to any advanced reactor operators. There are many developers pursuing designs that require HALEU, so even if a small number are ultimately successful, it is likely there will be plenty of demand for fuel that the bank would own.At government costs of capital, the additional cost of selling the HALEU on a longer-than-planned schedule is low, and some contingency for extended timing could be factored into the purchase price.Second, there is ongoing demand for HALEU to fuel research reactors. That demand is currently being satisfied by short-term solutions, but there is not an existing long-term solution. Even if demand from advanced reactors never develops—which would be a surprising scenario—the HALEU in the bank could be used for research reactor requirements over time.ConclusionLack of a long-term, reliable source of HALEU fuel represents a critical risk to the deployment of advanced reactors, which could be a key source of carbon-free electricity in the future. However, a HALEU fuel bank could resolve the conundrum facing advanced reactor developers and potential HALEU fuel suppliers by supporting the production of HALEU for advanced reactors and resolving the uncertainty faced by reactor developers and their potential customers and sources of financing. A bank would require initial capitalization, likely from the US government, but would ultimately return the funds. The risk to the initial capital would be limited since demand for the fuel would develop if any of the relevant reactor technologies is successful, and even if none of them comes to fruition, demand for HALEU could be supported by future requirements from research reactors. Such a bank merits serious consideration as part of the Department of Energy’s overall effort to support the development of advanced nuclear power.Stephen S.

6.6738114e+17,Moonwalker101,WSB/potentIal PM sQuEEze,"Just imagine what kind of impact something like this would have on gold and silver if this actually succeeds in just ONE state. The symbolism alone would set fire to gold and silver prices. Kansas Bill Would Make Gold and Silver Legal Tender in the StateFEBRUARY 21, 2021 BY MICHAEL MAHARREY 0 0A bill introduced in the Kansas House would recognize gold and silver specie as legal tender and repeal all taxes levied on it. The legislation would pave the way for Kansans to use gold and silver in everyday transactions, a foundational step for the people to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.The Federal Reserve is the engine that drives the most powerful government in the history of the world. Ron Paul popularized the slogan End the Fed, but Congress is nowhere near abolishing the central bank. It can’t even come up with the will to audit the Fed.Even though state action can’t end the Fed, there are steps states can take that will undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money. By passing laws that encourage and incentivize the use of gold and silver in daily transactions by the general public, policy changes at the state level such as the Kansas Legal Tender Act has the potential to create a wide-reaching impact and set the foundation to nullify the Fed’s monopoly power over the monetary system.A coalition of four Republicans introduced House Bill 2123 (HB2123) on Jan. 25. The legislation would make gold and silver legal tender in the state, recognizing it as a medium of exchange for the payment of debts and taxes. In effect, gold and silver specie would be treated as money, putting it on par with Federal Reserve notes in Kansas.Under the proposed law, Legal tender means a recognized medium of exchange for the payment of debts and taxes. Specie legal tender would be defined as:(a) Specie coin issued by the United States government at any time; or(b) any other specie that a court of competent jurisdiction, by final and unappealable order, rules to be within state authority to make or designate as legal tenderBy allowing the court to designate additional specie to be used as legal tender, Kansas could free its citizens from potential supply constraints imposed by the use of only United States minted gold and silver coin. More importantly, the people of the state of Kansas would be able to define what specie is considered constitutional tender, further distancing themselves from potential control of their competing currency by Washington D.C.Practically speaking, the passage of HB2123 would allow residents to use gold or silver coins to pay taxes and other debts owed to the state. In effect, it would put gold and silver on the same footing as Federal Reserve notes.HB2123 would also repeal property and capital gains taxes on gold and silver.No specie or legal tender shall be characterized as personal property for taxation or regulatory purposes.Passage of this bill would build on a foundation set in 2019 when Kansas repealed the sales tax on gold and silver.Kansas could become the fourth state to recognize gold and silver as legal tender. Utah led the way, reestablishing constitutional money in 2011. Wyoming and Oklahoma have since joined.KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERSTaxes on gold and silver erect barriers to using gold and silver as money by raising transaction costs. HB2123 would exempt gold and silver bullion from state capital gains taxes. Passage of this legislation would eliminate a barrier to investing in gold and silver. It would also make it more practical to gold and silver in everyday transactions, a foundational step for people to undermine the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.In effect, states that collect taxes on purchases of precious metals act as if gold and silver aren’t money at all.Imagine if you asked a grocery clerk to break a $5 bill and he charged you a 35 cent tax. Silly, right? After all, you were only exchanging one form of money for another. But that’s essentially what South Carolina’s capital gains tax on gold and silver bullion does. By eliminating this tax on the exchange of gold and silver, South Carolina would treat specie as money instead of a commodity. This represents a small step toward reestablishing gold and silver as legal tender and breaking down the Fed’s monopoly on money.We ought not to tax money – and that’s a good idea. It makes no sense to tax money, former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul said during testimony in support an Arizona bill that repealed capital gains taxes on gold and silver in that state. Paper is not money, it’s fraud, he continued.LEGALIZING THE CONSTITUTIONPassage of HB2123 would effectively legalize the US Constitution in Kansas.The United States Constitution states in Article I, Section 10, No State shall…make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts. Currently, all debts and taxes in South Carolina are either paid with Federal Reserve Notes (dollars) which were authorized as legal tender by Congress or with coins issued by the US Treasury — very few of which have gold or silver in them.The Federal Reserve destroys this constitutional monetary system by creating a monopoly based on its fiat currency. Without the backing of gold or silver, the central bank can easily create money out of thin air. This not only devalues your purchasing power over time; it also allows the federal government to borrow and spend far beyond what would be possible in a sound money system. Without the Fed, the US government wouldn’t be able to maintain all of its unconstitutional wars and programs.Passage of HB2123 would reestablish gold and silver as legal tender in the state and take a step toward that constitutional requirement, ignored for decades in every state.It would also begin the process of abolishing the Federal Reserve system by attacking it from the bottom up – pulling the rug out from under it by working to make its functions irrelevant at the state and local levels, and setting the stage to undermine the Federal Reserve monopoly by introducing competition into the monetary system.Constitutional tender expert Professor William Greene said when people in multiple states actually start using gold and silver instead of Federal Reserve Notes, it would effectively nullify the Federal Reserve and end the federal government’s monopoly on money.Over time, as residents of the state use both Federal Reserve notes and silver and gold coins, the fact that the coins hold their value more than Federal Reserve notes do will lead to a reverse Gresham’s Law effect, where good money (gold and silver coins) will drive out bad money (Federal Reserve notes). As this happens, a cascade of events can begin to occur, including the flow of real wealth toward the state’s treasury, an influx of banking business from outside of the state – as people in other states carry out their desire to bank with sound money – and an eventual outcry against the use of Federal Reserve notes for any transactions.Once things get to that point, Federal Reserve notes would become largely unwanted and irrelevant for ordinary people. Nullifying the Fed on a state-by-state level is what will get us there.Get Peter Schiff’s key gold headlines in your inbox every week – click here – for a free subscription to his exclusive weekly email updates.Interested in learning how to buy gold and buy silver?Call 1-888-GOLD-160 and speak with a Precious Metals Specialist today!Federal Reserve, gold, Kansas, silver, sound money",51232852

In addition, credit cards is the banks most risky product, carries a high Risk-weight hence making it expensive for banks to offer on a risk adjusted basis. So low revenue (as % of total), high losses and credit provisioning and Prudential requirement to hold capital against it puts it well low in the banking sectors priority list.

He wrote and explained that because of a series of one off teething problems we would not accurately know profitability until after the second shipment. All this I already reported.After reading Ahab‘s post tonight I went back and read the email from Gary again and, my apologies to all, I missed what I now think is the most important part. When explaining why we don’t know profitability until after this second ship load he continued, ‘we are however confident that if the price of iron ore remains above $110 to $120 the venture will remain profitable.’That is the bombshell fact, here is my conjecture. As long as the iron ore price remains above $110 to $120 Australian we will be making more than the $10 cut off mark for profit.

6.6738072e+17,mho25,Why arent we a $500m MC company yet?,"Originally posted by Kiwisfly9: ↑Correct me if Im wrong but the NPV of 114 million is based off the figures presented on page 7 of the DFS. If thats the case, then on that same page, it has listed the total ore mined is 2.6 MTs which as you mentioned earlier comes exclusively from Grants and BP33 because those are reserves as opposed to resources to deliver a NPV of 114 million.114 / 2.6 = 43.84 Million dollars per megaton of Spod delivered.43.84 Million X 15 MT = 657.6 Million dollarsSo it would be fair to say that MrPloughs calculations are approximately correct, assuming, however (and this is a big assuming) that those resources are all converted to reserves status, that the figures remain the same in terms of cost and profit per ton and that the scaling remains linear as opposed to economies of scale being found etc.If I have the math wrong, feel free to point it out. But it seems to me that youre debating a point of difference between the enterprise value expressed in reserves and resources and on what we had in the DFS reserve figures vs what we have now in total figures. Have I got that right?Also, if anybody sees my maths is wrong, please dont be shy and come to the party. It benefits us all if we are using the correct figures.ExpandYes thats what I was saying, 15Mt is the total known resource (which was 8Mt at the time of the 2019 DFS and was never the figure used for the NPV) which is different from the amount we actually mine in the first project/dfs. As per the screenshot we are only looking to mine 5.7Mt at the current known resource (so maybe more) at carlton, grants, bp33.15Mt includes the other sites which are not part of the dfs, not fully explored and may be tapped into later (see massive pyramid in every powerpoint).Your figures per ton are more pessimistic than mine so wed get around 200m npv at 5.7Mt.please see the screenshot which breakdown the underground, open pit Mt from our recent finds.",51232770

We’re slowly getting the old Raggertooth back with logical breakdowns Had to chuckle at the seed to exit comment too In terms of market cap, I have to admit... I do struggle to see how that’s one of your key reasonings behind the stock dropping. Let’s not get confused, market cap is calculated by multiplying the share price by the total number of outstanding shares. So in essence we’re still talking about what share price is fair value, which seems to be holding firm around the 13-15c mark post the recent selling frenzyI guess the other thing for me is that I don’t see it as emotional investing if I am predicting strong growth in industries in which FFG holds subsidiaries. It’s just an educated guess, right? Let’s look at icandy interactive for example. The mobile gaming industry has gone through the roof since Covid and that popularity isn’t going anywhere soon. Not to mention the rollout of 5G across SE Asia increasing the percentage of population who have access to mobile gaming. Don’t forget the Sky Candy joint venture either! While we’re yet to hear news on their first project, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to predict that it’ll be a cut above what icandy have produced in the pastAlso, I know the comparison to IOU and Afterpay annoys you... it does for me too! However, it’s not emotional to think that the BNPL sector is extremely popular right now! FFG/Smartfunding is carving its own unique place in that sector. And while it’s not going to be an IOU or Afterpay, it still has a lot of upside. It’s the potential of the industry we’re considering. I’m no real estate agent, but if you buy the worst house in an expensive neighbourhood (and FFG is still a pretty good house) it’s still going to be worth a lot of money, even if it’s not the best house. It’s about being in the right neighbourhood at the right time ExpandI don’t think that realestate can be used in comparison to keeping a business afloat in a competitive market. Money will need to be re-invested back into the business to grow. Marketing, advertising, business operating costs, staffing - these are all overheads that need to be addressed. Also, majority of BNPL are consumer focus - where Smartfunding is small business - bigger risk - the only positive factor is the peer-to-peer side. It offsets risk as using other people’s money, but they will have to give a bigger slice of the profit back to the investor. So making a lot less profit.

This is a business that I think has got a really good long-term structural growth story. But I think 2021, as we see the economy reopen, relaxation start to come back in, because of the number of hospitality merchants that it services, we should see some pretty strong growth. There are four catalysts I like about this business next year. Firstly, the volumes of transactions through the network are going to really start to accelerate. Between December 1 and December 11, they did 29% volume growth versus the PCP. So its already starting to come through. Secondly, youre going to see further market share gains and potentially the entry into some new verticals. Third, theres going to be the launch of TyroConnect, which is this integration hub they built around the point of sale (POS), which I think is going to create more customer loyalty and uptake. Fourth, I think the lending part of the business, which was frozen during COVID for good reasons, will start to go again. Its quite a profitable part of the business for them. So hopefully, Tyro does it for me this year.Source: https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/the-1-stock-picks-for-2021T.E.P.Expandhttps://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/tyro-not-terminal/It was meant to be a shocking result for Tyro. The payments company was in the doghouse with investors and customers after an embarrassing outage in mid-January that crippled their merchants, got splashed through the media and resulted in a class-action lawsuit. The technical glitch came on the back of a period where much of their customer base had been doing it tough with lockdowns and trading interruptions. So, you can imagine the surprise many investors would have felt when Tyro shares stormed higher following the release of their half-year results. It’s a classic case of shares rallying because investors worst fears simply didn’t materialise. The result is a welcome relief for Tyro shareholders and perhaps especially for Ben Clark from TMS Capital, who tipped Tyro as his #1 pick for 2021 just weeks before the outage. Ben was the winner of Livewire’s 2020 Fundies’ Stock Picks and undoubtedly many of our readers will be keen to get his thoughts. I called Ben at the time of the outage, and we agreed to have a chat post results when more information was available.Key stats from the Tyro result36,720 merchants, 13.2% higher compared to H1 FY20$12.1 billion in transaction processed by Tyro merchants, 10% higher compared H1 FY20Tyro is Australia’s 5th-largest merchant acquirer by terminal fleetRecord EBITDA of $8.5 million (H1 FY20: $1.5 million)EBITDA margin expansion from 3% to 13.8%11.764% the rally in Tyro shares following the results announcement Click on the image to enlargeA bit of backgroundTyro listed late in 2019 providing local investors with a pure play on the massive shift towards a cashless society. For context, it is estimated that the annual transaction value of card payments acquired in Australia was $660 billion as of June 2020. After a steady debut, Tyro got crunched as transaction volumes fell off a cliff amid the pandemic and the share price promptly caved from ~$4.30 to $1.30 in the space of a month.Clark says he had listened to its management a few times and was impressed; he added Tyro to his fund in May of 2020 in anticipation of tailwinds from a reopening economy.Back in May, we were coming out of the nationwide lockdown, and we thought that this was a business that was going to benefit from a reopening of the general economy. We were also looking at the fact that most businesses were going cashless as a result of that period. It was going to be a big beneficiary of that as well.Clark says the stock maintained a 3.5% position in his fund prior to the result today.A few surprises, mostly good ones!There were really two results in one for Tyro, the first being the performance for the first half of the current fiscal year. Tyro’s CEO, Robbie Cooke, described the result as ‘pleasing’ against the challenging backdrop. The firm now has 37,000 merchants using the service and this saw the company book a record $12.1 billion in transactions.Clark says the surprising aspect of the financial performance for Tyro was the EBITDA margin expansion which rose to 13.8%, up from 3% in the prior period. This was driven by a change in the mix of international vs domestic card transactions that were processed during the period.International card usage fell off a cliff, and that was replaced with a lot more local debit card usage. Thats actually seen them push toward a better profit number than the market anticipated.He adds that cost control for the period was ‘impressive’ and notes that, prior to the outage in January, customer churn rates were falling.The second point of interest was clearly going to be on the fallout from the terminal outages in January. Clark says the initial comments coming from Tyro’s management are encouraging, or at least not as bad as feared. He says that the firm is not seeing a material change in their merchant termination and surprisingly new merchant applications have been at ‘surprisingly normal’ levels. Clark says Tyro received 190 new applications last week and 818 new applications since the 1st of January.Tyro has also set aside a pool of $15 million to assist with remediation required with merchants and Clark says he is hopeful that the worst of the outage saga has been contained.I think the evidence is there that this isnt hopefully going to be a really nasty event financially for the company. They seem to have kept merchants on board at this point.Turning a negative into a positiveThe firm also told investors of the imminent release of a ‘dongle’ that would serve as a back-up service to all merchants. This backup offering will be an industry first and Clark says it is a sign that management is looking to turn a negative event into a competitive advantageFrom my impression, they havent handled this perfectly by any means, but I think theyve been pretty open and honest and transparent about it. I guess the main thing is that theyre not hoping this all just goes away, theyre actually trying to be proactive in terms of making sure that it doesnt happen again.Staying with the thesisThere are four pillars to Clark’s thesis on Tyro, which you can read here, and on the back of today’s result Clark says he has increased his position in the stock. Shares in Tyro finished the day 11.76% higher. Clearly, he wasnt alone.",51232715

The reason is that ours is better.There is no explanation given of how/why its better. I think there is strong evidence that Prognosis is superior to native on-premise monitoring tools. Ciscos own support for Prognosis over its own tool is proof of this.But there is a fundamental difference in the cloud. On-premise, the customer runs all the infrastructure; the servers, network cards, network, telephony devices, all the software that runs on this infrastructure. Prognosis pulls all of this information across many devices/nodes into a view that helps IT managers understand whats happening.In the cloud, Zoom or Microsoft run all of this. Do they allow IRI visibility over every component of their network and infrastructure for the purpose of monitoring? I seriously doubt it. Maybe there is an API that gives them some access to limited data, but in no way would it collect as much information as on-premise. Plus imagine the huge amount of data IRI would have to pull from the cloud to monitor.Until they can explain WHY their cloud monitoring tool is better than the native tool, Im on the sidelines.",51232682

Until it is implemented, we technically still own CGT assets. The relevant CGT event is likely to be a C2. The law for C2 (in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) states:104-25(1) CGT event C2 happens if your ownership of an intangible *CGT asset ends by the asset: (a) being redeemed or cancelled; or (b) being released, discharged or satisfied; or (c) expiring; or (d) being abandoned, surrendered or forfeited; or (e) if the asset is an option — being exercised; or (f) if the asset is a *convertible interest — being converted. 104-25(2) The time of the event is: (a) when you enter into the contract that results in the asset ending; or (b) if there is no contract — when the asset ends. It seems to me our shares will be cancelled. The latest announcement confirms the plan will go ahead, but says it still needs to be implemented. Following this implementation, our shares will be cancelled and the capital loss will arise. The announcement suggests it will happen in the first quarter of 2021, so hopefully soon.The confirmation definitively clears the path for the Company to successfully complete the Chapter 11 process after receiving final regulatory approvals and satisfying customary closing conditions, which is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2021.

Channel Contribution is a proxy for EBITDA but not perfect, as the Adairs stores EBITDA is derived by deducting the two Channel Contribution from reported Group EBITDA, which means that the Stores are wearing some of the unallocated Group overheads. Perhaps unfair, but if the online channels did not exist, the stores would have worn the overhead anyway.In 1HFY21 (see ADH ASX release)we had:Adairs on-line sales growth of 95%Mocka sales growth of 45%Adairs stores sales growth of 5%For the first 7 weeks of 2HFY21 the ADH ASX release reported:Adairs on-line sales growth of 65% YOYMocka sales growth of 50% YOYAdairs store sales growth of 12% YOYFor the purposes of generating a FY21 estimate, lets assume:Adairs on-line in H2FY21 grows only 50% YOY as it cycles the stellar Apr-May-June FY20 salesMocka in 2HFY21 holds its 50%, reflecting an improving inventory/out-of-stock positionAdairs stores in 2HFY21 has sales growth of 15%, as its cycles against FY20 closed storesThis gets us for FY21:Adairs on-line sales growth of ~75%Mocka on-line sales growth of ~50%Adairs stores sales growth of ~10%Assuming constant operating margins (no assumed operating leverage, tailwinds from FX etc) this gives FY21 forecast:Adairs online sales of $165mm and Channel Contribution/EBITDA of $60mmMocka sales of $45mm and Channel Contribution/EBITDA of $14mmAdairs stores sales of $290mm and EBITDA of $20mmFor the purposes of a prospective EV/EBITDA value, If we consider FY22 and plug in:Adairs on-line sales growth of 50%Mocka sales growth of 50%Adairs stores growth of 5%Derives FY22 EBITDA contributions ofAdairs online of $90mmMocka $20mmAdairs stores $21mmAssuming net cash of +$30mm, 10 x on the on-line businesses, and 5x on the stores we have:(110x10=1100)+(5x21=105) = EV 1205 + Net cash 30= Mkt Cap 1235 /Issued Cap 169mm= $7.30 per shareDYODDExpandWhat a coincidence.I happened to correspond yesterday with someone who knows Adairs better than most and they said they believed Adairs should trade around $7 given the EBITDA generated and the online sales growth momentum.They especially pointed out the Adairs market cap versus TPW.

This is a clear and distinct advantage to the Anteotech test. Don’t be fooled by these claims of 97% sensitivity. That’s a 97% sensitivity in the range 5-12 days(usually only with symptoms) while the Anteotech test is going to be testing from about day 2-3 all the way until about day 18. It’s very important to understand the LLOD and how that relates to the published sensitivity. Anteotech might publish a sensitivity of 97% however it will be a much superior test because of the LLOD and the ability to test for the virus earlier in the incubation stage before symptoms. If you understand this before results are published, it could possibly stop you from making a rash decision when the results are published. ExpandThank you for the clear reminder Slura.Timelines that signal efficient management become compromised when they are at the mercy of factors beyond control. In my opinion, the Anteo team have delivered remarkable timeline adherence over the past year that has been very important for shareholder confidence.The scientific statistics that stand next to a saliva or nasal test announcement from Anteo determine the future demand for the test but also stamps the scientific standing for Anteo.While we are all looking forward to the big announcement, hurdles will have been appearing from many angles.

Lets see how BET behaves this week and especially further to the $50m new shares being issued to trade on market Wednesday. Picking exact entry levels is a mugs game. No-one can do it.

6.6737838e+17,Popeye82,2020 BRN Discussion,"Originally posted by Popeye82: ↑Goodharts Law states that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. The reason is that when something becomes measured, people try to influence it, so the data that were going into the measure are no longer as pure as they were before. Ive started to wonder if this will happen with AI data sets.We see this behavior a lot in humans. When we know something is measured, or when we know we are being watched, we act differently. Its why surveys arent always accurate. Its why review systems are gamed. But it makes me wonder - will we adjust our behavior when we know our decisions are data inputs into AI systems?This gets particularly complicated when AI systems are doing more complicated decision making. It could particularly be bad if humans arent monitoring the data. For example, imagine an AI system that decides who gets a promotion at work. It monitors communication skills through emails and meeting recordings. It looks at work assigned in project management tools. All independent data, until someone finds out it is going into an AI tool for promotion analysis. Would that change how you might portray yourself, or those you like, to the system? After all, we do this to some extent when it is humans monitoring the systems. We call it corporate politics.My point here is that, one of the reasons we like AI for some tasks is that it is perceived to be objective. But they wont be objective if people start shading the data in the directions they want the algorithms to go. Humans game systems. I expect we will game AI as well.Thanks for reading.@RobMayExpandhttp://www.nextbigfuture.com/2020/12/80-times-more-energy-prototype-superconducting-chips-that-will-soon-reach-10-ghz.html",51232416

Your CDIs will be converted into shares on the London stock exchange. The exact form that they take will depend on what youve done with the notification. Computershare has been mailing holders with information about whats happening, and what you can do. The deadline for that decision was the 19th of February - meaning that if you didnt make a decision, youll get the default option.Your options were to sell the CDIs before the suspension of trade on Friday; to voluntarily convert them into London Pensana shares before the suspension of trade; or to elect to go through the voluntary sale facility that Pensana provided. The fourth option, the default option, was to have the CDIs converted into London Pensana shares, most likely in the form of a paper share certificate.If you didnt follow through on the correspondence, youll get your share certificate in the mail in the coming weeks (or months; Im not sure what the exact timeframe is.) You can then get in touch with a full service broker that will allow you to go through the dematerialising process (whereby the paper certificate is physically destroyed in the UK, and the shares registered electronically), after which you can sell them on the London stock exchange through the broker. Or you can find somebody on here who is happy to buy the share certificate from you and do the process themselves.The news has been well announced and documented.

6.6737682e+17,raw,News Articles,"Originally posted by dull1122: ↑Hey EverybodySpeaking of new Newspaper articles, I heard about one from Friday regarding a new provision that was added several years ago to GGGs exploration license. It said that several years ago the company agreed to add a clause into their agreement which said that if the government was to have a change in sentiment re uranium mining on political grounds, and decided that they did not want Uranium or Thorium mining, that GGG would agree, as the result of this new clause to not sue the government for its change of the terms to exclude that mining. Did you all see that in Fridays paper in Greenland?Also, I assume that the change was instigated, and actually done by Skove Neilsen who ran the mines department for the government at that time. However, when he left the government, after his contract was not renewed, the next day after his leaving his government employment and its mining and mining companies oversight responsibilities, that included overseeing the actions of GGG, he was immediately hired by GGG and went to work for them literally the next day, to represent GGG interests that he had been regulating, literally the day before. Does anyone think that could have created a conflict of InterestIsnt it ironic that he now is possibly affected in his work for GGG by language he inserted back then that could negatively impact his employer GGG, if, as some predict, IA wins the coming election in Greenland and changes its position to stand against uranium mining by GGG. They have said they oppose uranium mining have they not.Do think thats why, in many countries government employees are forbidden from representing companies they have been regulating for a period of some years to avoid these sorts of conflicts?Let me know your thoughts.Oh, and last but not least, what do you all think would the effect of GGG losing their right to ever mine Uranium might have on the value of the company? I dont know, has the company ever said they were going to mine the uranium, yes they have, and did they ever tell us about this new clause in their license they accepted?

6.6737658e+17,hillbilly1,WHK Fundamentals,"DHS Announces Steps to Advance Presidents Commitment to Elevate CybersecurityWASHINGTON – Today, Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas announced the many ways the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will carry out President Biden’s vision to elevate cybersecurity across the government. DHS will lead efforts to mitigate risks to the United States, further strengthen its partnerships with the private sector, and expand its investment in the infrastructure and people required to defend against malicious cyber attacks as part of a whole-of-government effort. Cybersecurity is more important than ever, and we will build on the Department’s excellent work as we transform our whole-of-government approach to tackle the challenge we face as a nation, said Secretary Mayorkas. This week is just the beginning of a series of actions DHS will pursue nationally and internationally to improve cybersecurity at all levels.DHS plays a key role in protecting the American people from threats in cyberspace. The Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is charged with securing Federal civilian government networks and our nation’s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. Congress, in the recent National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), further empowered CISA to execute this mission, including by providing authorities for CISA to hunt for cyber threats in federal agency networks and to more effectively identify vulnerable technologies used by critical infrastructure sectors. Over the past months, CISA has honed its capabilities and furthered the Department’s effort to advance national cybersecurity by: Leading the national effort to secure the 2020 election, including by sharing timely cybersecurity information with state and local election officials; Driving urgent remediation of risks posed by the exploitation of commonly used network management software and providing incident response assistance to compromised entities; Collaborating with government and private sector partners to disrupt and help protect against malicious activity perpetrated by North Korean actors against financial institutions, including the distribution of technical alerts to help network defenders protect against these threats; Issuing a directive to federal agencies requiring implementation of vulnerability disclosure programs, which allow security researchers to proactively identify weaknesses in government websites and applications; and Facilitating shared cybersecurity services that can be used by federal civilian agencies and SLTT governments to rapidly improve cybersecurity capabilities.Through the U.S. Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration, DHS plays a crucial role in increasing cybersecurity across the transportation sector, from aviation and rail to maritime and pipelines. The U.S. Secret Service and ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations combat 21st century crimes, many of which are cyber-enabled. For example, in 2020 alone, the Secret Service responded to 539 network intrusions, arrested over 1,000 people for cyber-financial crimes, and seized over $140 million in assets. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) and CISA recently announced the inaugural research and development awards for the newly launched Secure and Resilient Mobile Network Infrastructure project.DHS will continue to build on these achievements. This week, Secretary Mayorkas will increase the required minimum spend on cybersecurity through FEMA grant awards. To accelerate critical improvements in state and local cybersecurity, CISA will urgently evaluate and implement additional capabilities including potential new grant programs that will enable critical security investments. This is important: the nation’s cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest link. On Thursday, Secretary Mayorkas will speak at the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition and issue a call to action to build a diverse cybersecurity workforce and leverage DHS’s partnerships to tackle the growing risk from ransomware.Ransomware is a cyber pandemic that paralyzes cities, companies, and hospitals across the country. In October, CISA together with other government agencies warned of the growing threat of ransomware targeting the healthcare and public health sector. Previous incidents illustrate the risk ransomware poses to COVID-19 vaccine deployment efforts. Tackling ransomware will require partnering with private organizations, state, local, tribal, and territorial entities -- the hallmark of DHS’s approach to cybersecurity.Secretary Mayorkas will reinforce CISA’s new Reduce the Risk of Ransomware Campaign to encourage public and private sector organizations to take action to mitigate ransomware risk. DHS will also leverage the U.S. Secret Service, through its Cyber Fraud Task Forces, to respond to ransomware incidents and arrest those that engage in this criminal activity. Secretary Mayorkas is slated to participate in several additional engagements in the coming weeks to further highlight how the Department can and will best support its partners in efforts to improve risk management and cybersecurity. The Secretary will also engage with his foreign counterparts to strengthen international cybersecurity collaboration.The DHS workforce is committed to implementing President Biden’s vision of a more cybersecure America.",51232189

Endometriosis and Gardia Studies are looking extremely optimistic, The ground work Richard and his team are doing for PromarkerD lays the foundation for much quicker commercialisation of any future diagnostic tests. God knows PromarkD has been too long in the making, many lessons were learnt in the process. I think an excellent buying opportunity may present itself if phase 2 results￼ dont support a Cdx indication. The market will most likely perceive this as negative news and there may be a sell off, ￼ but it doesnt negate the fact the test still performs as originally designed and the commercialisation will still go forward. I will be looking out for this and will be buying as much as possible during that dip.ExpandI think we are in with a very good chance of success of predictive monitoring of patients while on treatment with Invokana (ie does the patients risk score for PD go down while on treatment). They are also looking at cardiovascular measures as well. Invokana is approved in the USA for both DKD/CKD & CVD. In the EU for DKD. I dug up the ANN in regards to the ongoing collaboration with Janssen FYI:https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02220200-6A973683?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4We should probably remember that in validating PromarkerD in the first Phase with Janssen, that patients were on either placebo or treatment with Invokana & PromarkerD was predictive of kidney function decline in both cohorts.Richard had warned at the time that this would be a complex study with a lot of data & if we are seeing prediction of cardiovascular events also in diabetes this will be explosive. There are now 4 top 10 Pharmas with SGLT2i (Janssen/J&J, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly & Boehringer Ingleheim) vying for a market share in DKD/CKD/CVD on successful large post market clinical trials in these indications & priority review with FDA in or already approved.They all have similar results from clinical trials across preventing ESRD & cardiovascular events in diabetics. So having a test that is accurately predictive for a Physician to see how their patient is travelling in regards to risk scores on treatment with a SGLT2i, will have an added advantage & potentially not just in nephrology but cardiology as well, it’s all connected.Potentially the test could be used across the whole drug class of SGLT2i which is SOC in these indications, so we really want this validation as a CDx for Invokana regardless.There is also the patent in the USA covering drug development using PromarkerD biomarkers, so covering the whole package really. From memory, I think Richard did say there was some hold ups during COVID-19 & this study was due for completion in Nov 2020, & now we are almost in March 2021. Not complaining, it’s a given in biotech investing & clinical trials/studies, but it’s gotta be very soon guys & gals! GLTAH",51232066

6.6737358e+17,JID,Tin price,"Wild ride as tin tips towards scarcity pricingReuters | February 22, 2021 | 8:23 am Intelligence Markets China Europe USA Tin Genuine scarcity pricing is becoming a reality for the tin market. (Stock Image)(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, Andy Home, a columnist for Reuters.)The bulls are running riot across industrial metals markets as investors bet on global covid-19 recovery.SIGN UP FOR THE AUSTRALASIA DIGESTSign UpCopper has grabbed the headlines by surging past $9,000 a tonne for the first time since 2011, but wildest of all is the tin market.London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month tin hit its own 10-year high of $27,000 a tonne on Monday morning after a week of unprecedented spread turbulence. LME stocks remain desperately low with no sign of relief from a squeezed physical supply chain.Chinese speculators are now getting in on the action, with Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) tin jumping to life-of-contract highs amid surging volumes and open interest.While other metals are rallying on expectations of resurgent demand and supply shortfall, genuine scarcity pricing is becoming a reality for the tin market.LME super-squeezeThe low-liquidity London tin contract has seen its fair share of squeezes before, but nothing compares with last week.The benchmark cash-to-three-month time spread flexed out to an extraordinary $6,500 a tonne backwardation at one stage.The cash premium was still a massive $2,525 a tonne at last Friday’s close. To put that into perspective, the previous record was $730 during an ultimately ill-fated attempt to squeeze the London contract in 2009.Someone came close to paying that record just to roll a position overnight last week. The LME’s tom-next spread traded at backwardation of $650 a tonne last Tuesday.The exchange’s positioning reports have consistently shown at least one, and as many as three, significant longs on the LME cash date, but these positions are measured against historically low non-cancelled stocks.SHANGHAI TRADING VOLUMES WERE A RECORD 287,569 CONTRACTS ON MONDAYThe extreme premium for cash metal has drawn some metal into LME warehouses. Inflows totalled 705 tonnes last week, most of it arriving at Malaysia’s Port Klang.Any impact, though, was diminished by the ensuing cancellation in the same location of 300 tonnes in preparation for physical load-out.It seems that what comes into the LME system isn’t going to stick around for long, which attests to the squeeze on the physical supply chain.Premiums soarThe LME has stepped up its surveillance of the tin contract, unsurprisingly given the extreme time-spread moves last week, but an exchange spokeswoman told Fastmarkets there is no indication that LME pricing has diverged from the underlying physical market.To judge by Fastmarkets’ assessment of the physical supply chain, that appears true.The premium for tin in warehouses in the US port of Baltimore has almost doubled so far this year to a record $900 to $1,100 a tonne.The United States is physically short of metal and the cost of container shipments from Asia has exploded owing to continued disruption in the global freight sector.LME stocks in the country total only 20 tonnes – delivered onto warrant on Friday – and there are only 10 tonnes in Europe at Rotterdam. Fastmarkets assesses the European physical tin premium at a lower $400 to $500 a tonne, but activity is said to be minimal because no one has any spare to trade.The global tin supply chain was hit especially hard by covid-19 mine lockdowns last year and is now struggling to keep pace with resurgent demand from the electronics sector.Consecutive years of production deficit have depleted inventories along the supply chain in a slow-fuse trend that is now exploding on the LME.China bullsThere are stocks of tin in China. The ShFE has 7,401 tonnes of registered stocks, up by 1,926 tonnes since the start of January.China, however, was a net importer of refined tin last year, reflecting both its own covid-19 supply disruption and its faster manufacturing recovery.Even if domestic producers can catch up with the country’s internal demand, an inversion of trade in favour of exports would need a profitable arbitrage window.That could prove a fleeting phenomenon as Chinese speculators flock into the Shanghai market, pushing the local price up to life-of-contract highs and closing any gap with London.Shanghai trading volumes were a record 287,569 contracts on Monday and open interest has mushroomed by 25% since Chinese markets reopened last Thursday.This is a typical Chinese commodity market crowd surge as investors rotate into a market with eye-catching price momentum.Scarcity pricingWall Street banks are warning about the potential for scarcity pricing in the copper market, but it has already arrived in the tiny tin market.The extremity of the LME price action – tin has risen by $3,500 a tonne in the space of a week – is signalling severe supply chain distress.Until the physical pipeline from Asian supply to European and North American buyers is refilled, premiums are going to remain elevated and LME short-position holders will be forced to compete with the physical market for units.Producers will, of course, respond to this screaming price signal, but the big question is how quickly they can do so.Time is of the essence for holders of LME short positions, as it is for the producers themselves.The flip side of scarcity pricing is what harm it does to demand.The tin market has underperformed other industrial metals over the past decade because of thrifting and miniaturisation in the electronics sector.The trend to use less tin in nano-soldering was a reaction to the super-high prices at the start of the past decade, when LME tin rose above $30,000 a tonne.Thanks to the yawning backwardations across nearby LME time spreads, the LME cash price last week touched a peak of $30,500.If producers don’t respond soon to calm the waters, tin users will start formulating their own reaction.(Editing by David Goodman)",51232050

Economists like Nouriel Roubini say that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. And a recent Deutsche Bank survey said investors view bitcoin as themost extreme bubble in financial markets.Digital gold?JPMorgan’s strategists said current bitcoin prices appear to be unsustainable unless the cryptocurrency becomes less volatile. They added their $146,000 price target hinged on bitcoin’s volatility converging to that of gold, which would likely take years to happen.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies have questionable diversification benefits and rank as the poorest hedge against significant drops in stock prices, JPMorgan’s analysts said.The bank has beenmaking a push into blockchain technologywith its own cryptocurrency called JPM Coin and a new business unit called Onyx.The rise of digital finance and demand for fintech alternatives is the real financial transformation story of the Covid-19 era, according to JPMorgan.Competition between banks and fintech is intensifying, with Big Tech possessing the most potent digital platforms due to their access to customer data, the bank said.″‘Co-opetition’ between ‘Fin’ and ‘Tech’ players lies ahead, with banks stepping up investment to narrow the technology gap, and the battle between US banks and non-bank fintech is also playing out on the regulatory front.Major tech companies likeAppleandGooglehave shown increased interest in financial services lately. Applelaunched its own credit cardin partnership withGoldman Sachs, while Google isletting its users open checking accountsfollowing a tie-up withCitigroup.Traditional banks could emerge as endgame winners in the digital age of banking due to their advantage from deposit franchise, risk management and regulation, JPMorgan said.Digital banking has boomed in the coronavirus era, with large lenders and fintechs alike seeing a surge in adoption as people are spending more time at home due to public health restrictions.ExpandI think it was you who said this but worth revisitingIf you invested 10k now in:- APT, you would receive 68 shares. - ZIP, you would receive 807 shares- IOU, you would receive 1875 sharesSay if all three companies put on an additional MC of $500mil in the coming months due to various vac rollouts, improved customer sentiment, pent-up demand etc. Or, simply, if one of these companies sign a single large merchant/payment gateway then this would be your return:- APT - $120- ZIP - $740- IOU - $20,800To put it in context, APT would need to put on $86billion in MC and ZIP $14billion in MC, in order to get you a return of $20,800 from your $10,000 investment. In another context, IOU would only need to put on a MC of $2.8mil for you to make a similar return on APTs MC increase of $500mil (i.e. $120).

CorenClimate reporterFebruary 22, 2021Lithium, a silvery metal so lightweight it floats on water, has been dubbed white gold. The element is key to the future of the automobile industry, increasingly powered by powerful batteries that require the metal, and meeting climate deadlines to decarbonize the global economy.After decades relying on imports, countries are now scrambling to secure their own domestic supplies of the crucial ingredient, also used in ceramics, glass, lubricants, and polymers. Lithium supply security has become a top priority for technology companies in the United States and Asia, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS) (pdf). The US Interior Department listed lithium as a critical mineral in 2018, fast-tracking mine permits.South America still supplies most of the world’s lithium (93% of US imports come from Argentina and Chile). The US has just one opening lithium mine (pdf) located in Nevada, and a single facility to recycle lithium-ion vehicle batteries in Ohio, according to the US Geological SurveyBut the US has 10% of the world’s estimated 73 million tons of proven reserves, and the lithium rush is spreading across the US, especially the American west, home to the richest and most accessible deposits. Around 2,000 lithium claims have been made on 30,000 acres of federal public land in California alone.In January, the US Bureau of Land Management approved a two-square-mile open-pit mine known as the Thacker Pass in Nevada. When it opens for business in a few years, it will be the nation’s largest source of lithium supply generating 60,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually. The mine, run Canadian-owned Lithium Americas, is expected to operate for at least 40 years.New way to mine?Lithium mining consumes enormous quantities of water in some of the world’s driest places. The world’s largest lithium mining operations in Chile’s Atacama desert pumps millions of gallons of water from dwindling underground reservoirs, then evaporates it in massive ponds stretching for miles. The minerals left behind are then collected and refined. Each ton of lithium mined this way uses about 18,000 gallons of freshwater, and takes up to two years.Thacker Pass in Nevada claims it will use less water, but will still need to pull from underground reservoirs and generate 5,800 tons of sulfuric acid each day on-site. That means shipping caustic chemicals by rail and trucking as many as 200 loads through local towns a day, reports the High Country News. Local residents and environmental groups have accused the Trump Administration of rushing the mine’s approval process in under a year and sued the federal government to halt construction.",51232038

6.6737196e+17,brombarb,Ann: Operations Update,"Originally posted by spinefx: ↑usernam,With the caveat that I am no oil man, these thoughts are just my interpretation of what Ive read and understand of the projects and the company.And I may well be completely wrong, in some cases I actually wish to be wrong.But, I think only Merlin will be drilled, it is the most likely of the 2 prospects. Harrier has a lower CoS, which although upgraded from earlier announcements from XCD/88e is still high risk.I believe the 2 well program was a carrot dangled to boost the balance sheet before Dave exits the building, leaving the incoming MD cashed up. Smart move, I think.As a standalone proposition, none of the projects stack up to me. Umiat has been flow tested but the thought is that its uneconomic at anything under $70bbl, the oil there is trapped in the permafrost and requires extra infrastructure to extract. Merlin would probably be a touch less on the breakeven.The issue is the isolation of these prospects, there is no infrastructure, so to develop would require, permanent roads, pipelines, pads etc. This is an enormous cost and commitment, for someone to take on.I really believe all the projects need to be economically viable for them to be taken up as a package.Some time ago the State of Alaska did up an Environmental Impact Statement for Umiat, with roads and pipeline (across Icewine) to TAPS, the forecast cost then was ~$200 mill. The plan was shelved.Ultimately at the moment its all pie in the sky stuff until commercial/economic oil is found, only then will we see any story play out.Just my thoughts.CheersExpandLincs Energy reckoned that Umiat could possibly be exploited without permanent roads - utilising winter roads only. It is located near to Umiat Airport so personnel changes and some logistics could be handled via that route if the plan was feasible.Summer tundra travel with appropriate vehicles is permissible and indeed some 3D activity has taken place during the summer. Pipeline would of course be necessary and you are right that we need Peregrine and probably Harpoon to all come in.",51232007

China will start recycling its steel from old building as it goes so reduction there yet their belts n roads projects will be hungry for steel.Either way your mine will go well with high demand & I wish you the best.An interesting point is we still have 940million people without power who cant turn on a light let alone freeze a pie we forget how lucky we are & the rest of us requiring transfer to greener solutions we will need everything and some to make it work.ExpandThanks for the thoughts Luke.My position in that company is centrally because its primary target market is the expandable flake graphite used in building materials as a flame retardant etc. Its a growing market since China have banned brominated products,this flake commands premium basket prices and is scarce in domestic China. Diversification is extremely attractive so having 2 target markets in expandable and EV was too good for me to pass.As for vanadium, its demand is only going to grow with the increase in demand for flow batteries. As for recycling of steel, due to changes in code I believe vanadium will still need to be mixed into old batches so supply and demand will likely be maintained and or growing.Redflow is just a super exciting product.I have personally had to evacuate a building a few years ago due to a lead acid battery fire and exploding batteries, was a very interesting day for both myself and emergency services. The smoke was so heavy visibility was next to zero in the car park where the UPS rooms are located. The situation was a little hairy for at least an hour why the fire fighters tried to assess if it was spreading in the building etc and getting power isolated between rather loud explosions.This sadly was not the last lead acid battery incident.Ive been meaning to discuss Redflow with Facilities and this Optus deal makes the conversation a lot easier to have than 2+ years ago before Redflow got the Thai factory properly sorted.I can see a huge demand in the coming years for building UPS support being replaced with batteries like Redflow due to their flame retardant and safety properties.Im seeing the Optus deal as the beginning of good things to come. When companies see Optus using our batteries they will likely see it as If the Redflow batteries are good enough for Optus than they are good enough for us imo.Cheers.",51231988
6.6737106e+17,bobby.,EVN chart,"Originally posted by loki01: ↑Alternatively. we could see USD POG heading down towards the USD1500-1600 region (which is still a historically high gold price) while the AUD either stays around its current level of USD0.78.5 or heads towards USD0.85. That would give a range of $A1764-2040/ounce. In the meantime mining input costs are rising due to range of reasons, including COVID,It is worthwhile to stress test ones resolve to remain goldie Hodlers in the face of further significant mine operating margin compression, especially Oz based goldies facing a rising AUD.The USD POG is generally seasonally weak from the Chinese New Year, and gets weaker post the PDAC conference (the PDAC Curse), unless there are special factors in play to support the gold price.The USD POG is facing headwinds from rising long term bond yields, without officially recorded inflation as real yields rise and this is the factor against which the USD POG is most heavily correlated (inversely). Think of a 1.8-1.9% yield on 10-year Treasuries compared to its low of 0.55 last August when the USD POG peaked.Unfortunately Chindian gold demand has been weak since the gold price took off, and govt purchases of gold has also fallen off, while the GLD ETF (and possibly other similar ETFs) has been selling down its gold holding over recent months.I just hope the gold price does not get below USD1500 or we will see mayham with the goldies much worse than what happened in March 2020. Back then the USD POG drop was largely offset by a falling AUD making Oz based goldies extremely cheap and a clear one way bet for those that bought them.Another issue that we need to recognise is that Oz based companies have gone into more marginal ore deposits over the last few years and that while that was a winning move as the AUD POG rose with a low AUD, its a major negative for profitability when costs and the AUD both rise.I am increasingly inclined to step back from the goldie market. It feels a lot like 2012, heading into 2013, and we all know what happened back then.My best hope is that the US Fed undertakes measures to control the longer dated yields, which would put a stop to rising interest rates while hopefully inflation takes off so that real interest rates fall/turn increasingly negative, preferably a lot.From what I have read it seems that the world economy is in a major expansion/recovery with rising business profitability until the middle of this year, which is positive for risk on assets and there is therefore movement out of gold. I am cashed up and may sell more of my goldies (now just holding some overseas based and a very few explorers, but may sell them also) in anticipation of some bottom in mid year or later in 2021. My largest holding is a company that has a legal dispute with the Thai government and I plan to ride this one to its settlement.My expectation is that quality companies such as EVN and SAR/NST will be on sale later on at lower prices - but anything could happen to make this a pipe dream.Good luck to all.loki (just saying, look at the downside - its potentially lower for us goldiebugs.)Expandlokire: recent years of oz mining of marginal ore depositsis it that they just choose to mine these deposits , and left the higher grade areas for a later time when the price of au gold may be lessor did they have no option because of aging and depleting mines also is it possible that we will now see an emerging interest from the majors in collaborating with or taking over juniors with proven resources as a way of solving the above issueas always i would be most interested in your viewscheers bobby",51231985

6.6737076e+17,Stephan90,EV and battery thread,"Centrica orders 2,000 more e-Vivaro vansThe British energy supply company Centrica is pushing ahead with the electrification of its fleet. The conversion of the entire fleet to electric vehicles is to take place by 2025, five years earlier than previously planned. With this increase in EV adoption, Centrica is now ordering 2,000 additional Vivaro-e from Vauxhall for its subsidiary British Gas. 1,000 Vivaro-e for British Gas were ordered in summer 2020. All 3,000 of the electric vans are to be in operation by next year. In the course of the renewed order with Vauxhall, Centrica also said that it would never buy another vehicle with an internal combustion engine. The utility company said it would place further orders for electric vehicles with Vauxhall as soon as they were available. Here Centrica is apparently alluding not only to the Vivaro-e for the technicians in customer service, but also to all other company and fleet cars. British Gas technicians are said to be able to volunteer to switch to the electric delivery vehicle. At the same time, the company said it will be prioritising areas with high pollution levels.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: It’s encouraging to see that one of Britain’s best-known brands is leading the way with the largest commercial EV fleet in the UK. He noted that: With more zero-emission models of cars and vans on the market than ever before, there has never been a better time for drivers and businesses to make the switch.Of course, this is a huge show of confidence in Vauxhall from Centrica. Paul Willcox, Managing Director of Vauxhall Motors, said:I am delighted that British Gas has added to its initial order of fully-electric Vauxhall Vivaro-e vans that now represents the largest electric vehicle order for a commercial fleet in the UK.Centrica signed up to the Climate Group’s EV100 initiative in summer 2019. This had seen the group commit to electrifying its entire vehicle fleets by 2030 – something that can be achieved as early as 2025, according to the new targets. Within a year, EV100 member companies have more than doubled the number of their e-vehicles, as a recently published annual report shows.Centrica orders 2,000 more e-Vivaro vans - electrive.com",51231976

It said that several years ago the company agreed to add a clause into their agreement which said that if the government was to have a change in sentiment re uranium mining on political grounds, and decided that they did not want Uranium or Thorium mining, that GGG would agree, as the result of this new clause to not sue the government for its change of the terms to exclude that mining. Did you all see that in Fridays paper in Greenland?Also, I assume that the change was instigated, and actually done by Skove Neilsen who ran the mines department for the government at that time. However, when he left the government, after his contract was not renewed, the next day after his leaving his government employment and its mining and mining companies oversight responsibilities, that included overseeing the actions of GGG, he was immediately hired by GGG and went to work for them literally the next day, to represent GGG interests that he had been regulating, literally the day before. Does anyone think that could have created a conflict of InterestIsnt it ironic that he now is possibly affected in his work for GGG by language he inserted back then that could negatively impact his employer GGG, if, as some predict, IA wins the coming election in Greenland and changes its position to stand against uranium mining by GGG. They have said they oppose uranium mining have they not.Do think thats why, in many countries government employees are forbidden from representing companies they have been regulating for a period of some years to avoid these sorts of conflicts?Let me know your thoughts.Oh, and last but not least, what do you all think would the effect of GGG losing their right to ever mine Uranium might have on the value of the company?

A lot of financial wisdom in this group!- The founder remains the largest shareholder and director.

Hopefully an under-promise and over-deliver type of CEO! The CFO is also great - keeps it simple.- Growing cash balance provides option to do acquisitions. 2018 acquisition of TeePublic obviously a brilliant buy. Do more of these!- RBL is currently under the radar in Australian financial press; gets very little mainstream coverage. This will change when it gets admitted to ASX200. - Two thirds of the business is in the biggest market in the world: USA. Huge room to grow there.

It is an essential component for electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving.The delivery of samples will begin as early as 2022.The automotive industry worldwide faces a semiconductor shortage, mainly involving microcontrollers in the 28 nm and 40 nm range.Japanese fabless designer Socionext will compete with Dutch firm NXP Semiconductors in the development of 5-nanometer automotive chips.TSMC is bolstering investment in new technologies that yield fatter margins. The latest 5 nm technology reportedly boasts 20% greater speed and uses 40% less power than the previous 7 nm generation.

Moho, which manages the JV, has recently earned 70% interest in. Burracoppin is located on an underexplored greenstone belt in the WA Wheatbelt.The Crossroads prospect is an emerging greenfields discovery only 20km from Ramelius’ (ASX:RMS) Edna May gold mine and is on structural trend to the Tampia gold deposit, also owned by Ramelius.In June last year a shallow aircore drill program at Crossroads hit anomalous (low grade) gold-silver mineralisation, with up to 0.61 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 5.53g/t silver in bedrock in ‘bottom of hole’ samples.Significantly, the mineralisation is ‘open’ to the south, east and at depth and is located on the northern margin of a pronounced gravity low.This gravity low may represent a felsic porphyry intrusion, Moho says.Porphyries are a real prize for juniors, responsible for ~60 per cent of the world’s copper, most of its molybdenum, and significant amounts of gold and silver.In November last year, Moho was awarded a co-funded drilling grant of up to $147,526 from the WA Government as part of its Exploration Incentive Scheme to test a potential intrusive mineral system at Crossroads.The explorer’s latest 32 hole, 3,108m drilling program was designed to test the source and extent of this anomalous mineralisation. Assays are due in six to eight weeks, the company says.Three diamond holes (~600m) will be drilled at locations to be determined following receipt of the RC assay results in March or April.Caption: Location of Crossroads gold/silver prospect, Burracoppin Gold Project.

It said that several years ago the company agreed to add a clause into their agreement which said that if the government was to have a change in sentiment re uranium mining on political grounds, and decided that they did not want Uranium or Thorium mining, that GGG would agree, as the result of this new clause to not sue the government for its change of the terms to exclude that mining. Did you all see that in Fridays paper in Greenland?Also, I assume that the change was instigated, and actually done by Skove Neilsen who ran the mines department for the government at that time. However, when he left the government, after his contract was not renewed, the next day after his leaving his government employment and its mining and mining companies oversight responsibilities, that included overseeing the actions of GGG, he was immediately hired by GGG and went to work for them literally the next day, to represent GGG interests that he had been regulating, literally the day before. Does anyone think that could have created a conflict of InterestIsnt it ironic that he now is possibly affected in his work for GGG by language he inserted back then that could negatively impact his employer GGG, if, as some predict, IA wins the coming election in Greenland and changes its position to stand against uranium mining by GGG. They have said they oppose uranium mining have they not.Do think thats why, in many countries government employees are forbidden from representing companies they have been regulating for a period of some years to avoid these sorts of conflicts?Let me know your thoughts.Oh, and last but not least, what do you all think would the effect of GGG losing their right to ever mine Uranium might have on the value of the company? I dont know, has the company ever said they were going to mine the uranium, yes they have, and did they ever tell us about this new clause in their license they accepted?

The most-traded SHFE 2104 copper contract rose by the daily trading limit to 67,370 yuan/mt on Monday February 22, and this was 18.5% higher than the lowest price on February 3.SMM interviewed Xu Maili, deputy director of the Everbright Futures Research Institute, about his views on this surge in copper prices. He thought that the rapid rise in copper prices has broken away from short-term fundamental support as currently supply from copper smelters was stable while demand did not improve out of expectations. In terms of macroeconomic environment, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases was curbed in China, and this, combined with easing global liquidity and economic stimulus packages lifted risk appetite.

So using your example:-10m @ 15gt = 150 gram meters Au where as 320m @ 1.5g/t = 480 gram metersSo my cut off for a Super hit Au result is a drill intersection reported of 300+ gram meters. So the second example I would determine as being a reportable super hit. I also would mention that I provide only a single result and most reports have many results. My intention is simply to provide a heads up of a high grade result for a company not to do all the analysis for you. Further detailed research/analysis is up to the reader really.

It certainly made me think long and hard about what was my current amateur view on BTC, which was that it, or something like it would ultimately be the worlds accepted currency of exchange. Whatever the instrument, I believe that the worlds governments and the very large players will always regulate and control it. The end of paper money is definately in sight, maybe not in my lifetime but certainly in the current younger generations. Not a big fan of conspiracy theories, and only basically educated, although have read much in my later years on how federal reserve banks evolved, four horseman, history of insurance and interest rates, how money printing really works and it leaves me very disillusioned. I may be from the wrong side of the tracks, but bring any one of these subjects up to a wide range of my peers and they would look at me as if I was from Mars.As for trading BTC, first looked at a few years ago when it was under $100. A couple of mates and I were discussing current affairs at the bar in Geraldton and two subjects came up for a couple of days; BTC and Trump possibly running for POTUS. Both items were laughed off by the mates but I actually had a good think about BTC. Always been fasvinated by trading in general but this new currency fascinated me as it was being touted as a free peer to peer exchange of value with no third party or government intervention or involvement (as you may imagine, not exactly in love with government or big business). So googled it for a couple of days with the idea of maybe buy 3 or 4 of these things. At the time had just come out of a very bad domestic situation, was bankrupted in the Pilbara and was on a very low fixed income. Suffice to say, the intricacies of the blockchain, the difficulty in purchasing these tokens, and distinct lack of funds put an end to it.Currently am trading XRP, as the spreads are suitable for my small account and have only deposited what I can afford to lose. Has been a great help in TA, and I have multiplied my account by 250% in a couple of months mainly selecting supply and demand and waiting.Do not envisage XRP being anything more than a trading instrument (contrary to some pundits) so am just trading the trade. If it reaches 4.80 as it has done, all good, if it touches 17 bucks, well hopefully I would have accumulated enough to retire comfortably.Sorry for long story also for grammar/spelling as am on phone.ExpandHi rick64It might surprise you but I never completed high school. I lived in Kings Cross back in the early 70s when the Vietnam War was the main concern (and we all worried about a possible nuclear War). As a teenager I could read but wasnt good with the big words. I am self educated (properly termed autodidactic) which also means I have become progressively more and more eccentric.

6.6725988e+17,rick64,Short Term Trading Weekend Lounge: 19 - 21 Feb,"Originally posted by Dazedandconfused: ↑BitCoin is a speculative bubble.....Not that anyone cares about my opinion.... but I just want to publicly say I think BTC is going to zero in the long run.At the moment it is probably still going higher and maybe much higher but when I look at it on fundamentals the whole thing seems completely vacuous... to my eyes.The negative case....*It is total BS that it can ever be a universal means of exchange... the transaction rate is something like 15 per second (compare that with 100,000 per second for credit card transaction rates). The various layers built over BTC to get around this problem compromise the integrity of the underlying asset.*BTC miners are an ever increasing drain on electricity supply... the infrastructure required to mine and sustain the network has to keep growing inverse to the dwindling number of BTCs yet to be mined. This is an ever increasing cost of doing business and has an inbuilt diminishing return factor (it can only be sustained if the price of BTC keeps rising).*BTC can not be used to pay taxes.... but already on the horizon some governments are looking into levering taxes on capital gains from BTC.*As BTC grows in adoption it begins to represent a competitor to state controlled currency... this is a long standing debate in the BTC fraternity... in my opinion, when it comes to control, state actors will legislate in their own favour. At the moment, it is an unregulated aspect of the crypto space which means the established banking industry has difficulty enabling on and off ramping BTC/fiat exchanges due to possible money laundering concerns. There is no incentive for state actors to create helpful legislation to alter this.*BTC is touted as financial freedom for the little guy... but what is happening is recently it is the financially large players which are hoovering up dominant holdings and creating demand. But, is it because they view BTC as a true asset? The financialization of BTC is well underway.... meaning, soon, the establishment of a futures market which will allow the creation of another derivatives market etc.etc. There is already a growing market where BTC can be used as collateral to secure loans in fiat etc.etc. On the surface this appears to confirm BTC as a genuine asset class.... but the first couple of points I make questions the fundamental assumptions. As far as I can see, it is only the adoption of BTC and the resulting network effect which gives any assurance of value. I would argue, it is this network effect which is being viewed as an opportunity to engage in financial engineering for profit as long as it lasts rather than seeing it as an early adoption of a new paradigm... i.e. it is cynical exploitation of speculation.*There is a subtle distinction which is being glossed over.... currently BTC is mostly deemed legal as an asset, but, importantly most jurisdictions deem BTC as illegal if used as a currency.... i.e. specifically rule that BTC is not legal tender.Which brings me to what I think are the real problems for BTC.BTC is the product of the Western Democratic financial environment... as a reaction to the accrued debt which can not be repaid and most recently which can no longer even be serviced. BTC has been presented as a store of value (i.e. a protector of wealth) which will maintain its purchasing power in the face of the universal money printing being conducted by principally the US and the EU (with others also joining in e.g. Australia etc.). That is not the whole context however.... faith in BTC (which is all it is) completely disregards the geopolitical reality... we are in the midst of a great power rivalry and undeclared cold war between China and the US. China will have an increasing say in how international finance is conducted... this will be so even if the cold war remains unresolved well into the future. As an authoritarian power China will in no way be a friend of BTC... and in fact, as possibly the largest holder of gold reserves will actively seek to leverage that position to its own benefit.The main debate is whether BTC is a genuine substitute for the traditionally held stores of value gold and silver. As it stands, central banks around the World, in recent years, have been buying gold and not BTC. Both China and Russia have made no secret they are substantial buyers of gold (and are HODLlers) and both are aligned together in opposition to the US. On the flipside, the US is deep in an ongoing financial crisis which appears to be worsening... which of necessity weakens their international influence. Still plenty of water under the bridge yet to flow but as I see it BTC does not have sufficient fundamental value to endure. In my opinion, what we are seeing with BTC is a bubble which might be a trade but it is not a genuine store of value.Expand@Dazedandconfused.A very well thought out and aticulated argument put forth sir. It certainly made me think long and hard about what was my current amateur view on BTC, which was that it, or something like it would ultimately be the worlds accepted currency of exchange. Whatever the instrument, I believe that the worlds governments and the very large players will always regulate and control it. The end of paper money is definately in sight, maybe not in my lifetime but certainly in the current younger generations. Not a big fan of conspiracy theories, and only basically educated, although have read much in my later years on how federal reserve banks evolved, four horseman, history of insurance and interest rates, how money printing really works and it leaves me very disillusioned. I may be from the wrong side of the tracks, but bring any one of these subjects up to a wide range of my peers and they would look at me as if I was from Mars.As for trading BTC, first looked at a few years ago when it was under $100. A couple of mates and I were discussing current affairs at the bar in Geraldton and two subjects came up for a couple of days; BTC and Trump possibly running for POTUS. Both items were laughed off by the mates but I actually had a good think about BTC. Always been fasvinated by trading in general but this new currency fascinated me as it was being touted as a free peer to peer exchange of value with no third party or government intervention or involvement (as you may imagine, not exactly in love with government or big business). So googled it for a couple of days with the idea of maybe buy 3 or 4 of these things. At the time had just come out of a very bad domestic situation, was bankrupted in the Pilbara and was on a very low fixed income. Suffice to say, the intricacies of the blockchain, the difficulty in purchasing these tokens, and distinct lack of funds put an end to it.Currently am trading XRP, as the spreads are suitable for my small account and have only deposited what I can afford to lose. Has been a great help in TA, and I have multiplied my account by 250% in a couple of months mainly selecting supply and demand and waiting.Do not envisage XRP being anything more than a trading instrument (contrary to some pundits) so am just trading the trade. If it reaches 4.80 as it has done, all good, if it touches 17 bucks, well hopefully I would have accumulated enough to retire comfortably.Sorry for long story also for grammar/spelling as am on phone.",51198082

The various layers built over BTC to get around this problem compromise the integrity of the underlying asset.*BTC miners are an ever increasing drain on electricity supply... the infrastructure required to mine and sustain the network has to keep growing inverse to the dwindling number of BTCs yet to be mined. This is an ever increasing cost of doing business and has an inbuilt diminishing return factor (it can only be sustained if the price of BTC keeps rising).*BTC can not be used to pay taxes.... but already on the horizon some governments are looking into levering taxes on capital gains from BTC.*As BTC grows in adoption it begins to represent a competitor to state controlled currency... this is a long standing debate in the BTC fraternity... in my opinion, when it comes to control, state actors will legislate in their own favour. At the moment, it is an unregulated aspect of the crypto space which means the established banking industry has difficulty enabling on and off ramping BTC/fiat exchanges due to possible money laundering concerns. There is no incentive for state actors to create helpful legislation to alter this.*BTC is touted as financial freedom for the little guy... but what is happening is recently it is the financially large players which are hoovering up dominant holdings and creating demand.

6.6720534e+17,Diver Dan,Short Term Trading Weekend Lounge: 19 - 21 Feb,"Happy weekend traders,On Friday in the US, the SPX closed at 3906.71 or -0.19% on moderately positive market internals.  That was just one of the disparities that made trading more difficult than usual. I mentioned Friday was volatile and should say I was trading the futures and mean the entire session including after Australias Friday cash equity close.  That is historical volatility rather than implied, although they can be related.  The VIX did take a bit of a run lower before moving near neutral and closing at 22.05 or -1.96% on the day.  The March expirations will likely have more gyrations, but we must reset things first.   Hedging - both downside and upside protection and in single stocks, indices, and futures - can often confine or, on the unwind, determine the moves in the SPX going into expiration. The range on the SPX futures, ESH21, was broad and kind of eccentric.  If you were trading or just watching that and the ASX SPI futures, you probably saw the pressured moves.   Was the late session action part of the monthly derivatives rollover or was it the falling treasuries?  Or was it both. The futures can often offer good insight into what traders are thinking.With the ES contract, the first thing to note is that the area with 70% of volume is in line and overlaps perfectly with all the other days in the bracket that begins at 3880.  Value can track stability, but it is only one thing to consider. The volume point of control (where the most contracts were traded) had been at the top distribution area around 3920, but nearly as many contracts traded later in the session at the lower distribution area, where the most time was spent.   So this leaves us with a sort of neutral feeling about what happened.  It is kind of a wash.If you have a look at the charts below (that show not just price and volume, but time), you will see the two general areas of distribution that were created in the bracket between 3880 and 3925.  The thick concentration is around 3910 and one is around 3920, but that is getting into the weeds unless you are trading intraday.  You could detect this with other methods too.  You dont need the TPO charts, but it is certainly helpful.  Recall that 3925 was sort of a pivot going into expiration and the 3900 area was a point of contention (or weekly area where bulls and bears would fight).  We did manage to hold 3900, but the fact that we could not get over 3925 puts us in limbo as traders eye the bottom of the range spanning 8-12 Feb, and the 20-day moving average.Support starts with the weekly low of ES 3880.50 followed by the untested high-volume node from 4 Feb at 3855.75, just below the SPX 20-day average that comes in about 3862.   Next weeks support becomes much stiffer around 3850 and the SPX 30 day moving average, but if that fails, there is another naked point of control from 3 Feb at 3827.   These are closing basis levels and shifts in hedging during the week can make for fast breaks below.  For resistance, traders will likely concentrate first at a congestion area around 3910. Anything above 3925 where we failed on Friday means traders again view 3930 and after that the all-time high as in play.  SPX/ES 3900 obviously remains immediate point of struggle for Monday, but the mid-week situation needs the clarity of hedging activity and US Treasury action that will become clearer early in the session.While waiting for clues, participants will also think about the broader market situation: i.e., what did the other indices and sectors and Treasuries do and upcoming economic and policy releases.  The NDX and RUT have bounced from their 20-day averages but the SPX and DJIA have not come near their own.  Until we get more information we just wait and drift along.",51188053

The backtesting is a bit more extensive here - I have used 20 years of data here to validate the strategy whereas I have only been using 6-8 years of data to develop my FX strategies.I will apply this strategy only to ASX300 stocks - I prefer to stay away from the small caps, plus I also am looking to ensure I have sufficient liquidity to enter and exit positions when I want to (not difficult in the beginning since my positions are small, but I expect as the strategy unfolds and the equity balance grows, due to compounding the position sizes will grow over time).The strategy will be a weekly price action strategies (I will constrain all the equities strategies I develop to weekly price action, for ease of execution).This strategy is based on weekly open gaps, but I will include 3 specific types:Weekly gap up opens Which I call type v6):Weekly gap down opens (which I call type v5):And finally a multi-gap structure (which I call type v2) which occurs if there are at least 2 weeky gap opens (doesnt matter whether up or down) within a 5 week period, and the entry & stoploss is based on whether the most recent gap is up or down according to above. Also in this case, I will accept an entry in weeks 1-5 as opposed to just 2-5, after the gap open bar.Each of the above has some constraints placed upon them, not the same for each type, such as a minimum average weekly volume required, minimum price level, and certain other details of the bars themselves (bar range, close). There is only one indicator used - the RSI - which is used only for one of the three types, otherwise its all pure price action based.Money management is based on a starting equity balance of $50,000:Position sizing will be a fixed % of the current closed position balance (and therefore invoke compounding)For gap types v5 & v6, the risk per trade will start at 0.5% of closed position balanceFor gap type v2, the risk per trade will start at 1.0% of closed position balance (type v2 gives significantly better results than types v5 & v6)After 6 months, the above percentages will double, i.e. I will apply the above reduced risk % for an introductory 6 monthsThe position size is therefore calculated as the above risk % in $ (for example 1% x $50,000 = $500) from which I deduct closed position brokerage ($22 total) and the remainder is divided by the difference between the entry price and stoploss price to obtain the position sizeTrade management is as follows. Unless the stoploss price is hit, or there is an intervening ex-div date, the positions will be closed at fixed periods from the week of entry:Type v2 gaps will be closed at the close of the 2nd Friday from the week of entryType v5 gap trades will be closed at the close of the 3rd Friday from the week of entryType v6 gap trades will be closed at the close of the 13th Friday from the week of entryIf there is an intervening ex-div date due, the position will be closed at the close of the day before going ex-divI have only just started this strategy this week, and so far I have the following entries:Based on my backtesting history over 20 years, I only expect 2-3 entries per week (about 100-150 per year) so I will provide a weekly update include the watchlist for the upcoming week, and positon/account summary, but any day when an entry is triggered I will post the entry so that it is not a hindsight entry.Lets see how we go...Cheers, SharksPS: Dont expect to see me achieving a gazillion % return on this strategy, based on my backtesting I am hoping for a long term average of around 40-50% return (uncompounded)",50352046

The trades would all be live trades, not demo, and my strategies are all, for the time being, focused on the ASX300 - plenty of money to be made in this space with good strategies imo.If the above sounds of interest, then I will start posting something later.Cheers, Sharks",50341530

We have never done this before or accepted kind of to do on the stt But if a challenger wants you chart a stock for fifty dollars would you be willing in comparison ?ExpandSorry mate, i posted this on the 5 Grander, but this is a more appropriate place ...What Id really like to see is something larger than a five grander.Id like to see a fifty grander ... a virtual one so as not to disadvantage those who dont have a portfolio that large.Each person runs their own spreadsheet. An honor system. We could set up a template spreadsheet firstly to help out those who arent too good at Excel, but also so there is some consistency in how trading is reported. No need for CC or Ammie to get involved. They have enough to do already. Each person must call a buy or a sell on the same day they do it. None of this coming back after two weeks and saying Ive made a bag. I think theres enough eagle eyes on the STT to call someone out.Whats missing on the STT is how do you go about your trading?Do you pyramid your way into and out of a position?If something rises 50% what percentage of your holding do you sell?How many stocks do you hold?Do you just focus on one sector, or spread the risk across multiple sectors?Do you just hold speckys or do you hold real companies as well?Do you hold high conviction stocks, medium conviction stocks and maybe pilot buys?No stock can hold more than 50% of your portfolio.How do you select a stock ... are you doing research ... if so how much, how many hours do you put in.Are you doing scans ... if so, what settings do you use. How often do you do scans?Do you eyeball lots of charts?Do you get information from the Twits?Do you check with the Mystical One before you buy a bit of fluff? (god help you)Do you use Broker Data?Do you take note of comments or tips on the HC Forums ... or from the STT?What trading rules do you have?Do you buy at market price, or do you set your buy price a couple of rungs down the ladder and just wait for a seller to come to you?Do you accumulate your position, or do you just go bang?Do you sit glued to the computer screen all day? Do you rely on message alerts? Do you have a full time job and you can only look at lunchtime?etc etc etc the list is endless. When someone comes on the STT out of nowhere and says look at me Ive just made a bag, Im always thinking yeah but when you stuffed up like we all do, did you cut your losses short?Two prizes? Firstly the biggest portfolio, secondly the best managed portfolio (very subjective ... voted on by the STT faithful)Maybe its just a 3 month competition, and not 12 months as the interest would wane otherwise. Also 3 months makes it more in synch with the whole notion of Short Term Trading.Any interest?",50324876
