My question is, everyone I am seeing involved with ETF’s/index’s and the likes are doing it in a Roth IRA/401k. Am I not making a good decision by just having it in an individual brokerage account (Ameritrade). I tried googling it but couldn’t find a definitive answer on why you should invest in them in an IRA. I was a heroin addict for almost 10 years and got clean 10 years ago (in September) so I’ve always been very poor and only last year caught up with my debt and am debt free/built my credit with a baby credit card. I’m afraid to put my money in an IRA because of not being able to access it. (Only have about 8.5k saved, 2300 of it invested, 1300 in ETF’s and the rest in stocks.  Sadly my work does not offer a 401k. So basically am I dumb for investing in ETF’s without an IRA/401k?"

I got AMD at $87 and AAPL at $129. I currently have two shares in DIS at $187.39 and $186.00. DIS made a concave up today despite great earnings and got worried as this was the time of year last year DIS dropped. For insight purposes, I got DIS last year at $90 and sold at $140. I reinvested a week ago because I pulled out of the other stocks.Although the pandemic did hit around this time of year last year, DIS has a reoccurring history of dropping in Q2. However, I really am invested in the company as Disneyland Park and their Cruise Line has not opened to the public yet, movie theatres being closed, and Disney+ just getting a little more than a year under its belt. Albeit I am a fan of Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and the Parks, I am afraid that those attachments might cost me money.Any other DIS investors here? Is it undervalued? Is it overvalued?

I personally don't have any stake in TSLA, even indirectly through a fund or ETF.This isn't to say that the sub is wrong for thinking this, I'm wary of TSLA's current state at the moment myself and as such I steered to invest my ETF portfolio into ARKG and ARKF, as well as NERD for eSports and gaming.However, I don't see how one could apply the same critique for ARKG and ARKF as they have zero holdings in TSLA and have really good holdings in their respective sectors with lots of room to grow in the next 1-3 years. Many of the companies with ARKG and ARKF are buy candidates and undervalued per my DD. I've also seen Cathie position ARKG in terms of a more long term position with her recent trades in the fund this week.Am I wrong in thinking this?"

I have a few questions about ETFs and what would be a good route for me for my future. I’ve tried to do some stock trading over the last 2 years and it has been ok but I mostly invested into long term plays. Tried my hand at shorter term trades and was down about 1000$ because i just got nervous with the ups and downs and ended up selling too early. Looking back my DD was actually pretty good and if I would’ve just stuck it out on a few trades that 1000$ in the hole would’ve been pretty good return. Unfortunately I just don’t think active trading is for me. I have a 60,000 year job in Canada. I’m 36. No kids and no wife. I have a unique situation where I moved back into my moms at 33 because she got a brain tumor. My bills amount to 150$ month and no rent. I’m probably close to getting a promotion at work which would push me to 75K yearly. Take home pay after taxes is prob 3500 average monthly. I jumped into a few ETFs already. ARKK which I know is higher risk and QQQJ. I have some shares in Disney and Nvidia and Corsair which I got cheap for long term hold. What other ETFs should I be looking at to diversify? Canadian or USA? Thanks for any help guys and gals I appreciate it."

Where to Start? I started trading Forex for the first time 10+ years ago. It was more like playing and exploring, I never invested significant amounts in it.Back in 2016 I built some computers for cryptocurrency mining, not because I was genuinely interested in crypto, but just because I wanted to spend some of my company's money and reduce taxes in that way. That's how I got involved with cryptocurrencies.Since then I'm trying to trade cryptocurrencies but without much success. My problem is, I still consider cryptocurrencies a ponzi and can't be relaxed when invested. Instead to hold I always panic sell when prices drop below my entry point and then don't re-buy lower. Each times prices drop I think this is the end, and the whole market will crash.Now I want to try to invest in stocks, because I would feel much more relaxed if I invest in real companies. I would be able to hold for months and not to check prices every 5 minutes.I never tried investing in stocks because:- I have no idea where I can buy stocks. What platform someone who's not from the USA and EU can use? Is there a good platform for international users?- I don't know where to start and how to find my niche. There is so much stocks, but how to pick some?I'm not looking for 50% profits overnight, I'm not into overhyped projects that are already too high. I'm interested in investing in companies/stocks that are in slight uptrend, without too much volatility. Something with possible steady, slow growth. I don't want to get rich quickly, just to invest my cash in something that's not very risky (such as crypto) and to watch it grow faster than inflation.Any recommendations for me regarding trading platforms and stocks sectors?"

Very new and have been scared to dip my foot in the water, but I need to learn sometime!  I use ameritrade, and when you buy or sell a stock, it's in lots of 100.  But you can adjust that to however many you want to buy.  Is that the same way with options?  For example, can I buy 1 option contract or do I have to buy 100?  Also, if I want to but an option, am I on the hook for the stock price and the price of the option contract?  So say the stock is $5, and I think it's going to go up to 5.50, and the call option is .15.  Am I paying 5.15 for 1 option contract, or .15 for one?  Or (like said above) do I have to buy 100 contract (500+15=15)?  Finally, here's where it gets a little iffy.  When do you let it expire?  So if I think it goes up to 5.50, and it goes down to 4.50, I have to pay the different (1 contract=.50, 100=$50) or buy the stock at the 5.50 price and lose $1 per stock?  Or can I just let it expire as worthless?  And if it goes up to $6, does the contract execute automatically and I get those shares?  How can you sell a contract before it's execution date?

The advantage is by deferring taxes, you can have more money growing in investments.Roth - you pay taxes on the money you put in like normal, but then you don't have to pay taxes on returns.The downside to 401ks, like you pointed out, is if you access the money before you are 59 and 1/2 - You pay a 10% penalty. With IRAs, you pay the penalty on the returns, but you can withdraw your initial investment early, without penalty.Personally, I keep an emergency fund in cash.

Thus, on the assumption that we retail investors can't time the market (so any attempt to guess at But THIS time we're in the 33% bucket! is a fools' errand), I generally just play the numbers: lump-sum does better than DCA 2/3 times, so invest my investable dollars as soon as I get them. On the other hand, that same study only saw lump-sum beating DCA by an average of around 2% (2.3% for US, 2.2% UK, 1.3% AUS) after 10 years. That particular 2% number is specific to all the variables of that study (the country, the time period, and the portfolio), but demonstrates a basic qualitative point: although lump-sum seems to historically beat DCA, it's not by a huge margin.

That means that owning those other funds alongside VTI doesn't diversify you, it concentrates you in whatever companies they overlap on. For example, here are their top 6 holdings:VTI: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Tesla, Google (two share classes)SCHG: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google (two share classes), TeslaSPLG: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google (two share classes), TeslaQQQ: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, one Google share class, Facebook (and then the other Google share class is 7th)In fact, FTEC is a US-only IT sector fund made up of almost only large-cap companies which means, again, its holdings are largely (honestly, it might be entirely, but I don't know for sure) overlapping with VTI again. It's largest holdings? Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Visa, Paypal, Mastercard. Treating the two Google share classes as one, Visa is VTI's 10th biggest holding, NVIDIA is it's 13th, and Mastercard is it's 16th.There's nothing wrong with holding overlapping funds if that's what you intend to do for some reason (e.g., maybe you want to own the whole US market but make an outsized bet on tech, so you own VTI plus some FTEC on top of it), but that's not what this looks like. Basically, you have a bunch of broad US index funds (leaning a bit towards larger-cap and growth-style companies) and then IXUS (a good international index fund). I would add bonds and maybe up the international exposure a bit, but (as a start) I think 80% VTI, 20% IXUS (or VXUS if you wanted to have matching Vanguard funds) would make more sense than this.EDIT - I see in your note that you recognize the overlap in tech but again, I think it's overly complex for no real reason. As I alluded to (lucky guess!) if you wanted broad US with some tech focus, VTI+something like FTEC might make more sense."

It could be related to the share or voting structure of the shares. One thing to know is that foreign entities and in particular Chinese foreign entities structures can be complex. For $jd - if you read through their SEC 20-F filing - you can get a flavor of the complexity. Chinese regulation do not allow for direct foreign company ownership. So the way that JD is setup is that there is a Cayman Island company which then has variable interest entity structures with various subsidiaries of JD. The ADS that trades in the US is actually of that Cayman Island company. So the ADS value can be different than the shares traded on HK.

Being wary of TSLA is reasonable - even if TSLA stock doubles over the next year, without the benefit of a crystal ball it wouldn't be a great investment decision imo.I agree with you on ARKG and ARKF. It would greatly surprise me if either of these hit serious trouble without some (as of now) unforseen reason. They are both pretty modern and forward - good room to grow. It's exactly the kind of sector I would lean towards beyond if looking to do something a bit more ambitious than just invest into a very diverse or generic ETF. Although equally (and I'm not sure if this is the sub's reasoning) I have a lot of respect for the position of I want to invest and not lose money. I am aware of my own ignorance. I know that stocks/ economics is a lot more complicated than just a few simple calculations you can do through a few hours of googling. Because of all of this, I am just going to put my money into a very generic/ safe/ proven set of ETFs/ bonds/ etc. Part of my own investment strategy is always to hedge against myself slightly, because I'm very aware that I will automatically have an egocentric bias of how smart I am or how hard I worked or how much research I did.

There are no investment opportunities that are both likely to return good gains (good ambition) and are also low risk. The reason for this is really simple - if such things existed, everyone would realise it, the price would adjust to that new consensus, and then it wouldn't be a good deal anymore. And the #1 rule of the stock market is to realise that there are a lot of actors in it - and a lot of them will probably know a lot more than you (whether legally or not).For individual stocks vs ETFs - obviously individual stocks are way higher risk. They are also higher ambition. AAPL/ MSFT is less risky than a more unknown company with more uncertain finances or market histories - but it's still a risk. There could be a scandal or big news story, bad earnings report or some kind of fraud - and AAPL/ MSFT could drop by 10%+ in a matter of minutes.ETFs (or your own personal ETF which is made up of a split of shares between a load of companies) are much less sensitive to this.  They are still sensitive to the overall market of course - but then if there is a market crash/ depression  and you have money in stocks in any form - you're probably going to lose money.Really - it comes down to you. Do you really strongly believe in a few individual companies? Would you rather invest in a sector of companies (e.g. mobile phone companies), or something broader (e.g. American tech companies) or even broader (American companies) or even broader again (some kind of worldwide ETF). There is no right or wrong answer here - it's about risk."

But that's a much longer view and is also kind of a no-brainer (energy, techonlogy, etc is obviously the future just as it is the present). These kinds of innovation companies in rapidly moving markets (particularly given COVID) can be pretty volatile both ways. If you're looking for a 17% net return over 3 years or something, you could easily be disappointed.The biggest piece of advice I'd give (particularly if we're talking about $1k+ investments here) is to not follow the advice of some random guys on reddit unless you can see evidence of all their research and DD. There are some better articles, videos, etc out there on this kind of information as well as tracking past performances (which are imperfect). A lot of the research and published DD is also going to be flawed and often biased - if at all possible you'd ideally get to read up on people who are both bullish and bearish on any of these. But fundamentally this is just a subreddit (albeit a larger one). And I could be a 14 year old who knows nothing about economics, or I could be a 35 year old CEO. My post history isn't going to tell you for certain, and neither are the opinions of other users/ mods/ articles found on here. A really important part of investing is to due your own research (or pay someone you trust to do it for you) and then to be extremely mindful of how you might be wrong or biased, and then act accordingly."

Then, invest $500 into whatever your chosen investment is each month for a year. This is called dollar cost averaging. It gets your money in off the sideline, but ensures that if the market crashes in the near future, it might not be quite as crushing (e.g., if it crashes in 2 months, it'll only smush $1k of your investment, and you can buy into a low market with $5k).

Most seem to be established companies that have expensive shares. Share price is (essentially) irrelevant, it's just the result of the company's overall market capitalization divided by the number of shares. Microstrategy (MSTR) is a company with a market cap of ~$9 billion and has shares of $929.63. Biglari Holdings Inc. (BH.A) is a tiny ~$370m company, but has a share price of $500+. Meanwhile, Ford is a $45 billion company but has a share price of just ~$11.50.If you have $100 invested in a company, you have $100 invested in a company whether that's 100 $1 shares or 1 $100 share.Are penny stocks more or less reliable than these?No. Here's a basic rundown but, in short, they can be rife with fraud and are quite risky. Being cheaper doesn't make them better or gains easier. A 100% jump in share price is a 100% jump in share price, regardless of if that's going from 1 penny to 2, 1 dollar to 2, or $100 to $200. Again, if you have $100 invested in a company and it goes up 10% on good news (let's say), you have $110 whether you had 100 $1 shares (so now have 100 $1.10 shares) or 1 $100 share (that's now 1 $110 share).Is it better to play the game every day and try to sell at the end of the day, or is it better to focus on the long term?The long term. Even professional fund managers - people who do this for a living, have more experience and education than you, more resources than you, and more information than you - have an extremely difficult time beating the market long-term. Realistically, you're not going to consistently outpick stocks over someone responsible for tens of millions at Goldman Sachs, let's say. Which means that, long-term, trying to play the market each day is a losing game. It's like playing blackjack in Vegas: you might get lucky on a hand here or there but, long-term, the odds are stacked in their favor and you will probably lose out overall. So, instead of trying to beat them, many (myself included) invest in funds that track the market itself. Something like an S&P500 index fund (like, say, VOO) or a US Total Market fund (like, say, VTI). A fund like that owns lots of different stock positions. It won't give you the big ups (like if Apple has some new iPhone that blows peoples' socks off and it has a great quarter) but is also won't have the big downs (like if some pharmaceutical company gets bad news from the FDA and it's stock collapses). Instead, investing in something like that is a hope for more normalized, long-term gains from the general growth of the economy and the market over time.Second, I'm not sure what some of the terms you guys use mean. Whale, pumping, three digit hell, etc.None of those are really key terms, but a lack of familiarity only further suggests that a simple, conservative strategy is better than trying to beat the market.Lastly, I know one of my best long term moves will be to invest in Bitcoin. Should I do so now or wait to see if it drops below $50k?Why do you believe that's one of your best long term moves? It's a digital token that's existed for just 10 years and is primarily useful for money laundering and buying drugs, right now. Maybe it'll work out long term, but it's an extremely risky and aggressive move, not a definitely/clearly good long-term move."

Doesn't sound great but it's extra money for owning a small piece of a company. Obviously the more shares you own the more money you receive annually from the dividend. Its paid out quarterly (3months) unless it's a REIT dividend (I can explain that dividend if need be). When you hear of passive income, dividends is a big way to achieve passive income.Taxes do apply to the money that dividends creates, unless shelter in a tax free account.

Makes sense on missing on tax free stock gains from the Roth   The US bonds in my 401k is 45% government, 27% corporate, and 29% securitized. 70% AAA rated.  For the international bonds in the Roth IRA I was looking at VTABX which is more evenly split making credit ratings I also have a small pension so if Social Security is still around, my wife and I remain married, and tax brackets don't change a lot my taxable withdrawals from the 401k will not cause a ton of tax burden but there is definitely a large risk if some of that changes.  I have an option for Roth 401k as well but I hate the thought of paying the 24% tax on the contributions as those tax savings are being used as contributions into my Roth IRA. If the status quo remains I would be paying maybe 10 to 15% when I withdraw 401k in retirement.  If I end up single however and taxes increases I could end up paying more than the 24% and pay it on gains as well. There are so many variables .Thanks for your input."

So, I just got a new job which affords me a salary so that I can invest $2 000 every month and still live comfortably. I’m 27 and is able to live without paying for housing or food the next 1,5-2 years (a real luxury). My goal is to afford a down payment on an apartment which is a realistic goal by my calculations. I don’t have anyone dependent on me, so I’m willing to take some risks (but not YOLO it all away). So I like the idea of not going all in. The thing is, I’ll invest monthly regardless, so maybe it’s not a bad idea to go invest 4-5k now and let it sit for 1-2 years for better potential returns? I suppose in the end it’s all about how much risk I’m willing to take on. Regarding individual stocks... maybe you’re right? I’m certainly no expert. I’d go for established ETFs if I could but I can’t. Would you suggest mutual funds?"

Isn't this sub about investing, and all investing involves risk. I just happen to be lopsided in Crypto lolI meant it like I'm gonna' take my ball and home. By go home, I just meant go home from the casino of crypto (to me, crypto is far more of a gamble/casino than true investing) and into something more conservative that'll set you up for life. Still investing, sure, but like... In VTI or something dull like that.Think about it: with a paid-for house and retirement nest egg that's probably sufficient (or nearly so) with virtually no further contributions, that makes whatever salary you do earn for the rest of your working life basically all yours to enjoy along the way.

Just reading as much as you can to start. Investopedia is an excellent resource for terminology and basic investing. There's a site called the white coat investor that is targeted towards doctors, but that has excellent information to help young professionals learn to carve out retirement. Depending on your age the number one investment you should be making is in increasing your income (perhaps education or opening your own business, or doing the hours to increase the rank of a trades license).I would always recommend anyone start purely indexed. You will absolutely meet the market this way. Then you allocate 10% of your portfolio towards your selections. Your first few attempts will likely underperform the market and this will be valuable education you will pay for. Eventually you'll find a strategy that works for you, or like most people you will overtime underperform the market. Routine buying and selling in a taxable account will almost certainly result in failure. It's not a sexy message, but it is backed up by a wealth of research.Index initially, and then branch out.

So yes - it's not about the value of the shares but the number of shares.So in your example - if the stock went to $10,000 and the stock was still paying $1 per share. That would mean that the yield is now %0.01. Yield is calculated as the dividend payout divided by the current price.If you are getting yield info for a stock from a website - check it from day to day.

Instead I held them over the weekend and they're now selling (bid price) for $0.10.with only a sub 15% chance of the price closing above $17.50 on Friday these options have a much lower value as they are very likely to expire worthless, if they somehow bounce significantly that price could jump if they are at or above $17.50 on close (19th Feb) or in whatever timeframe around there my broker feels appropriate...

You bought in saying the price was going to go from 15.90ish to 17.50 paying .51 a contract.  It went and you could have sold for .65 a contract, but you held, and it went down to a stock price of 16.10 with little chance to get to 17.50 by Friday.  So if you would have sold it at .65 cents you would have pocketed a difference of .15 a contract.  As it is now, unless it gets at or above 17.50, it will expire as worthless and you're only out (# of contracts)x.51 (original contract price).  If it would go up to say 18.00, you would execute the contract, and make .50 a share.So if you do execute the contract, do you have to keep the stock?  Or does it sell and you just pocket the difference?  Also, is my calculation right on the initial trade?  You are just in for the # of contracts x .51?  So if you bought 100 contracts, you'd be in it for $51?  Or 51 plus the price of each share of the stock?  The real world data there cleared up a lot of things.  Thank you for that!"

Not saying that's bad (work is fulfilling and good for someone when done right) - just clarifying that's what you mean.I mean, for a start I was assuming you were around 30 (though you say here mid 30s so I wasn't far off). That's relevant as $500k in your 30s is different (life-set-up-wise) from $500k in your 50s.And second, it's all a matter of degrees. Obviously, $10m would be even better. Then you could set aside a million or two towards retirement, know you never have to touch it, and still have millions to live off of the rest of what would've been your working life as well without working. But you don't have that, you have ~$500k. And, to me, the best life strategy move among the available options of let it ride on crypto, take a break from working life as long as that money will last me, or my post... Yes, what I laid out is, to me, what I'd do to set myself up the most.I guess I can't shake the feeling of, I'm probably at the peak of my physical fitness in my mid 30s, so it seems silly I keep driving to work every day when I could literally not for about 5-10 years and come out the other side still financially better off than everyone around me. That's a life questions I can't expect anyone else to answer for me though :)It's a fair point. If you've already taken some profit and paid off your house and still have $500k atop that, then you're right: you could ride that $500k into the ground for a few years and still be better off financially than most on the other end. Every person is different. I'd just rather be pretty darn set for the rest of my life (even if I continue to have some obligations rather than be free and clear for 5-10 years, only to return to meaningful obligations to fulfill for ~20 years after that.Some of this turns on what you meant by having already taken some profit (as this analysis is different depending how big this nut is). And some also turns on why you want to stop working. $58k/year is perfectly nice, but it's not world-beatingly awesome (US median household income was ~$69k in 2019. Working doesn't have to mean you don't otherwise enjoy yourself: you could put (pulling numbers out of thin air as an example) 80% of that post-taxes nut into retirement, use the remaining 20% as a bridge to tide you over, and find a more easy going job. Maybe it doesn't pay quite as much, but you're already heavily set-up, so can handle the difference.And, maybe tomorrow Bitcoin is 20K again and this conversation is completely differentYeah, I would (again, this is all me, I'm not your financial advisor) sell it regardless of what you are planning to do with that cash.

My guess is the hedge funds in China (the ones that returned 30% on average) jump in and buy the dip to pump it up even more which then causes FOMO buying by the hedge funds that dumped and so on. All just driving the price higher until they all get FUD and jump out.

Right now, only financial news outlets are really talking about this rally but most non mainstream news outlets are too busy with Covid, Politics, and Weather at the moment to fit Bitcoin into the news cycle. Also, this rally is being clearly being fueled by institutions whereas 2017s run was mostly, looking from the outside in, retail which makes me believe that this rally will be more sustainable as institutions would not let an asset they are invested in have the massive crashes like it has done before. Will we still see ~50% drops, probably, but really doubt it'll crash more than that unless we somehow go vertical once again which imo would be 250,000 or more in 2021. Then I could see a drop to 50k, but once again, I highly doubt institutions would let bitcoin rise that high that fast ever again.Edit: how I plan to determine if we're near the top is if I see a new article on bitcoin reach the front page of my local news network for a couple days or it is featured in the none financial section of the broadcast explaining what is crypto and bitcoin, with a headline of something along the lines of Bitcoin Craze or something like that"

As far as technology -- that has to do with layering.Remember -- Gold is a Layer 1 money. For millenia people tried to find more efficient ways to transport and transact with gold.Multiple Layer 2 technologies emerged.England for example used a very successful Tally Stick system. The sticks were the currency, used for microtransactions, and easy to store and carry. But they derived their value from Gold.China's tea merchants created Flying Money the first paper money in the world (although backed by iron).However, the Government (originally Sung Dynasty) promptly took over Flying Money with the promise they would keep the same value they printed backed up by iron in the treasury.However they quickly reduced thay to about 35% backed up.Then zero.In fact, over the course of 600 years and 5 currencies under 5 different dynasties this process played out again and again, each time with the currency going to zero after unpegging it to anything.No matter what, Governments could never resist the allure of printing endless amounts of instant liquidity...all under the illusion that a delicate balancing act would allow them to do it this time without consequences.Silver could be thought of as a kind of Layer 2 technology as it facilitated micropayments as well.But in the US the Dollar killed silver as currency because the dollar was a better, more convenient Layer 2 technology over gold for better, easier, faster payments that were easier to travel with...etc.In every case -- transactions were ultimately settled in gold between banks for example, but the currency allowed for faster transactions.Of course now the world has currency that is backed by absolutely nothing making it worthless and pointless to hold.Therefore, in effect, paper money is a Layer 2 technology built over the top of Gold (layer 1 money).What you see with Bitcoin is the first time in 5,000 years that a new Layer 1 money system has been created.And as Raoul Pal says, It's eating the world.So to scale, what happens is the same thing that happened with gold -- Layer 2 technologies are built over the top of it to facilitate micropayments while large international settlements are done in Bitcoin.And the Layer 2 technology essentially derives its value either directly from Bitcoin or by trading against it (such as gold / silver ratio).There are ways this could play out.Perhaps one crypto will become a preferred currency while people hold Bitcoin long term as their preserve of value (again similar to the gold / silver relationship used to be).Or, as is already in the works, a layer 2 technology (Lightning Network) is built over the top to facilitate fast daily transactions.As it is now, people aren't spending their Bitcoin.People are desperate for Good Money that has sound principles, but that can be carried anywhere, transferred without a third party, and cannot be confiscated.So thats the main allure right now.There is also the fact that services like Blockfi.com offer the highest interest rates in the world right now (8.6% APY for Stablecoin, 6% APY for Bitcoin).Where else is capital supposed to flow?The most natural place for capital to flow is the Good Money of the world and where the highest yields are as well.And with physical Gold, I cannot divide it by 100,000,000 nor can I send it anywhere in the world 24/7 with the touch of a button. Nor can I travel freeky with it across all borders.I like gold, but I can't take my coins or bars on a casual plane trip from one country to another for example without declaring it...etc...etc.But I can literally travel with millions worth of Bitcoin...in my brain."

And the reason why it's seen as a hedge by many is directly linked to the fact that unlike in traditional markets there is actually accountability for each share, the owner has full control at all times and can verify everything, and there isn't any risk of runaway inflation or over-leveraged banks that can take you down.

My reasons are that the base chain needs to be rock solid secure with a very small attack surface and as Ethereum has a full language built in (Bitcoin script is deliberately simple to minimise attack surface) it is a much harder system to maintain. A second layer that has the smarts in will limit damage if it has an error.But it's not worth ruling out either option at this stage.

Short and sweet, there is an amount of BTC or ETH backing of up each share of GBTC or ETHE. It’s a ratio that changes slightly each day, but that is on their main webpage for each product.When issued, it’s at NAV. However when it hits the secondary market it is priced per market forces. As you noted, no redemptions... so that’s part of why the price doesn’t track particularly well (and the 6 month wait). The irony isn’t lost on me, but Grayscale is running everything per SEC laws and it is a nice way to get crypto exposure in an IRA.

But just addressing the current digital currency (Visa) vs Bitcoin (layer 1 settlement) Bitcoin is still faster than visa and actually safer for the merchant than visa. If I sent you Bitcoin you would see it in your wallet almost immediately. Just like if I swiped a card. The difference is, Bitcoin needs confirmations to be considered final, and after 3 the transaction is considered final. Whereas visa is not considered final for 72 days or whatever the call back refund period is for said credit cards. But they control the system so they can pull the money back for any reason, yours or theirs. So in this ONE scenario, Bitcoin wins.I would also recommend looking up the lightning network (layer 2 protocol) which addresses high fees and settlement time. Spoiler alert: fees are less than a penny, and settlement is as fast as your internet. So 2 second delay tops, usually."

It's basically fiat money with inbuild monitoring and control. Very useful for governments and central banks, but could get orwellian pretty fast. In many ways it's the antithesis of true cryptocurrencies. I suspect that the possibly slightly orwellian nature of CBDC's could even drive further adoption of crypto, but who knows"

Kraken received a banking license last year, and is one of the oldest XMR<-->fiat pairs. Also, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (lead regulator for US Banks), released guidance a few weeks ago specifying that all blockchains, including those with enhanced AML risks, are permissble for banks to use. Finally, watching the primary concerns of central banks regarding CBDCs, privacy is basically one of their #1 concerns.Overall, I think that it's moreso the chain analysis, exchanges, and miner corporations that have been trying to suppress Monero. Obviously XMR largely invalidates chain analysis business model, but moreover, Monero took great pains to ensure that ASIC miners weren't able to scoop up the majority of new issuance at launch. So the miners and exchanges don't have large amounts to dump on retail at market tops, so they're not really promoting it.But despite all this, Monero is continually exhibiting signs of organic adoption and growth. It's an uphill battle, but one I think will be fruitful."

The divisibility of the coins is actually a plus: if the service is roughly pegged to a fixed value, and the coin doubles in USD price, then the service will cost half as many coins. So the utility of the service is unaffected by coin price, allowing supply and demand to adjust the coin price without affecting the utility of the network. So early on the service might cost 1000 coins, but as the project matures that same service might cost 100, then 10, and eventually 0.001 while still compensating everyone involved in the service provision appropriately.If you are really curious, here is a summary of LTOs token model https://blog.ltonetwork.com/deflationary-asset-burning-defi-model/And here is a summary  of TRAC's: https://origintrailexplained.info/#tracIf you are AT ALL curious about how this works in practice I highly recommend taking a day or two to read up on the whole crypto ecosystem.

The link above wanted to boot him out and force him to reduce expenses.This morning I noticed ARKW, ARKQ and ARKK were all in red territories dropped from -2 to -3.4%.

Founders and venture capitalists will absolutely kill it here, which of course explains the timing.I must be getting old but it honestly doesn't feel like that long ago there were a tiny number of unicorns, and it being unusual to have any company valued at $1bn+ pre flotation.

Additionally, I see a future where Bitcoin is integrated enough that it will become the new denomination, namely a Satoshi. Or 1 millionth of a Bitcoin.

Creating the technology needed to establish life on Mars is and always has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public company diminishes that likelihood, then we should not do so until Mars is secure. This is something that I am open to reconsidering, but, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to foist being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature of our mission.Some at SpaceX who have not been through a public company experience may think that being public is desirable. This is not so. Public company stocks, particularly if big step changes in technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for reasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except the economy. This causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating great products.For those who are under the impression that they are so clever that they can outsmart public market investors and would sell SpaceX stock at the “right time,” let me relieve you of any such notion. If you really are better than most hedge fund managers, then there is no need to worry about the value of your SpaceX stock, as you can just invest in other public company stocks and make billions of dollars in the market.Elon"

There's really no point in hiding much of the visible part of SpaceX, which means, stockholders get to watch Elon blow up a huge expensive rocket every few weeks.  As a private company, Elon is free to blow up as many rockets as he wants to and only has to answer to his own bank account (and a few investors who have the intestinal fortitude to sit back and patiently watch while Elon quite literally sets their money on fire over and over again)Bring on stockholders and a board of directors who Elon has to answer to, rather than the other way around, and you risk what happened to Apple in 1985.  The board will see Starship as a huge waste and focus on the current cash cow that is the Falcon series, missing the bigger picture in the process."

Space X hasn’t saved any money by reusing rockets.

We know a reused launch costs them ~$28M, which is less than half of the $62M starting price for a F9.   They have actually spent more as time has gone on. Evidence? If it wasn’t for the NASA contract it would have gone bust.

But like I'm in the city and 70-80 a month is not uncommon.  There's even a strong case for government to subsidize the price, because of what a huge economic force it will be.

I would like to see what they have in assets, accesible cash... Because of all the richest guys (Buffett, Bezos), I think most of them are richer than Musk is, at least in assts. Yes, the shares in Musk's companies are very valuable... but they all depend on Musk being healthy and alive. The shares of Berkshire Hathaway will take a plunge, but survive Buffett's death. Amazon will of course would survive Bezos' disappearance. Tesla, though? If something happens to Musk (and I pray for that not to happen and I'm an atheist), Tesla shares would sink until a new CEO was announced. The company would survive at this point, but the market valuation at $850, certainly would not. Surprisingly, I think SpaceX would very easily survive, since there's Gwynne Shotwell and she's well known enough.   So, yeah, Musk is rich, but I do not think he is by any means the richest in the world, considering how overvalued his stock is (I agree with it being overvalued, what they are doing is great and necessary and if it costs money, so be it). I think the valuation of Tesla is way too volatile to take it that seriously."

Space debris is going to be our next big global issue and we're going to lock ourselves in our own planet because we keep sending junk up to the orbit zone without second thought.Even in developing countries network infrastructure is rapidly improving (Africa basically skipped landlines and moved into mobile because towers got set up so quickly).

However, I have the choice of multiple ISPs and access to high-bandwidth, as I live in a US suburb.  Those with more limited options are more likely to find SpaceX attractive.As far as jamming goes - it is certainly possible, but also the sort of thing that isn't very desirable internationally.  I could see a country like China or Russia maybe doing it (though really I could also see SpaceX just cutting a deal with them).  The problems with this sort of jamming are:It is hard to do against the ground stations, since there are many of them all over the place and getting LOS to them is difficult.It is easy to do against the satellites (few of them, and easy to get LOS), but when you do it you're potentially blocking access to it outside your jurisdiction (if you're a smaller country or you try to cover your border areas).  Doing it against the satellites themselves, especially civilian ones, is a bit of a provocation.  Messing with spy satellites is a game everybody has probably played at some point.  Messing with civilian communications satellites usually is off-limits.If a country like China starts jamming SpaceX satellites when they're overhead, what is to stop somebody from jamming a Chinese-launched satellite in geosync just about anywhere?  How about weather satellites?  That sort of thing can get really expensive fast, as most people aren't hardening civilian satellites against state-level attacks.  The threat is of course always there, so that may result in a lot of diplomatic-level dealmaking, which will end up trickling down to SpaceX and others in this business.  They won't talk about it publicly, but they simply won't offer services that breach whatever compromise is brokered.What nations might do instead of jamming is getting more serious about policing their citizens.  An aircraft at high altitude could probably locate any dishes talking to Starlink, and then they can just do whatever it is they do when people do things the government doesn't like.  That sort of thing is hard to do with broadcast TV and so on, but much easier against 2-way communications like internet traffic."

Only one part is specifically for the reports from JP Morgan, which is what I’m talking about right now.The ones about specific stocks are like tenish page documents. About half is charts and financial data, and the other half is a more holistic description of the situation. Investment thesis, risks, catalysts, macro and micro conditions. Pretty much anything I could think to ask for. A lot of it is based on publicly available data, but I noticed several instances where the analyst references industry contacts that they consult with about the significance/validity of certain points. They also compare their own models with the company’s own guidance sometimes. Pretty interesting stuff.Other documents are more of an analysis on bigger scale, like the conditions for REITs. That one is a much larger document, like fifty pages."

If the Federal Reserve targets inflation at 2% and we see a repeat of +3.5% in 2011 and +4-5% such as in 2008, then how does the Federal Reserve not raise rates?On top of that, Lumber is at 52 week high, really in uncharted territory, almost double its historic price. This is undoubtedly impacting non-food consumer goods across the board.Some of these prices are driven by weather, but some geo-political. Swine flu is dying down in China driving soybean prices up due to larger hog herd, Russia (#3 producer) is restricting wheat exports, Argentina (#4 producer) suspending corn exports due to drought. Byproducts of these commodities such as beef, pork, poultry and dairy will likely raise significantly as costs go up.On top of this we are seeing a $15 dollar minimum wage push in the U.S. that will undoubtedly hit he bottom line for food prices as manual labor benefits. Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa should be confirmed as agricultural secretary is a huge bull on ethanol which should continue to rise corn prices.Energy wise, a rebound from covid should drive up oil demand along with the administrations policies on restricting additional exploration, drilling and pipelines."

It’s fluctuating between $28-31 today, when earnings were supposedly made public for the first time. The consistent downward movement from $38 last Monday down to $31 Friday was a lot more significant than the “dip” we are seeing today post-earnings. It almost feels like the mediocre earnings are priced in at this point given performance last week, and that maybe last week’s dip was based on premature knowledge of the earnings report. Not sure what other publicly facing information would lead to such a significant dip while legitimate “negative” PR from today’s earnings shows a much smaller impact. As usual, PLTR announces good news (last week’s IBM contract is the latest example) and then the stock goes red, lol. Personally I think the stock might continue to dip after lockup expires. I’m bullish long term but this could be painful for a while. I’ll likely increase my position if it closes in around $25 and then not look at it again for 3 years lol. While insiders likely understand how valuable PLTR can be long term there could be a strong incentive to take cash now and leverage it elsewhere in this infinite bull market rather than sit on a bunch of PLTR shares that might not print for another 3+ years."

If it doesn’t, they will continue to get worse and more annoying.

Maybe I'm jaded by selling TSLA pre-split, but I've finally come to terms with the fact that social media enables irrational stock swings far outside any explanation that has to do with the company's fundamentals or even its potential. If a bunch of people want to buy something, price goes up. They only realize value by selling, though, so then the price will go down. When market cap of something is fantastically higher than its conceivable value and the price keeps going up... I know someone is making a lot of money, but they're not making it from the company. They're making it from other people who bought or sold at the wrong time. I don't trust myself not to be one of those people, so... boring, value investing for me.Add to this that they build products to spy on people.This is a hurdle for me as well.

As much as everyone who’s bullish thinks no one at Palantir will be selling stocks in volume, I’d question the likelihood of us not seeing significant sales volume off the back off this. Even those that really believe in the company and where it’s going are likely to want to realise some nice profits on a percentage of their holdings.The only risk in waiting to see how lock up plays out (eg if driven down significantly) is that you may miss the current drop / dip, and if lock up expiry doesn’t lead to a larger sell off, find that the stock continues quickly upwards - leaving you to get in higher.I sold for a profit at the start of the drop.

I can kind of tell people have a misconception about tech companies because they seem to think everybody who works at Palantir is a programmer when most of their staff is actually administrative, like sales, marketing, legal, finance, HR, etc. Having worked in tech, many of their employees probably do not understand anything about their stocks other than what its price is."

But to not cash out to benefit from their high risk decision to take a lower salary on the premise of taking company stake to supplement that lower salary would be surprising. Some employees have probably been locked in for years and not switching companies because of the potential pay day they'll have from a successful ipo.

Maybe buy some positions now, in case the dip Friday doesn't actually bring it lower than today, but I wouldn't do more than half.B) Bearish on PLTR and holding right now, sell on Wednesday or Thursday (I say wait a few days because it was a strong drop today, it'll likely recover somewhat before Friday)All that said, I'm personally bearish on PLTR long-term. For the next few months it'll still be going strong, but the next time the market as a whole sees a correction, I don't anticipate that PLTR will ever come back with the same P/E strength that it has now."

It's traded above $24 a share ever since and was it was over $50 a share a year later.Also interesting to see you have to go back almost a decade for any examples of this.

They have so much capital, but they make half to 3/4 efforts of using it to for anything, because they're seemingly late to the party, be it on streaming, EV, etc.They can't seem to land a deal with a good company on EV (Hyundai would have been absolutely ideal), and so here we are with the same apple products out that everyone knows and is familiar with, with competition on a roughly equal playing field.The good news for them is how they have negotiated contracts with cell phone companies to keep allowing new purchases of phones - the free upgrade. They need to continue to push free months of apple TV on those new phone plans, and hopefully put out some good streaming content.As for EV, I'm not sure where they should go.

In short: The main issue is that nuclear just isn’t cost efficient. Talking about nuclear waste or risk of nuclear incidents isn’t needed because there is no economic incentive for nuclear.Look up the budgets for construction of recent nuclear powerplants. They are expensive as f*ck, and usually go over budget by a lot(outside of China). Sure; when you look at the cost of operation over 50 years it all might seem like a fair-ish but wind and solar are a lot less expensive and in 20 years those costs will most likely be even lower.50 years is a long time and it’s almost certain are that our energy needs will change a lot during that time.Nuclear plants are slow to build often taking upwards of 15 years to build and require a heavily investment in centralized grid infrastructure. I think its not that strange that that the people deciding are reluctant to invest in technology that that is more expensive, heavily centralized and will be obsolete before it has payed out its dividend.Wind, solar, decentralization of power grids and (maybe) hydrogen seem to be a better bet from my point of view.And that is if we make strides in the field of energy storage. If energy storage in bulk becomes only a bit more efficient all talk about nuclear will be moot.TLDR: nuclear fission is inflexible, has huge upfront costs and is quite expensive per MW."

Oil is plastic and in fertilizers and it will take a long time until most of the world will switch to Electic Vehicles and even longer to replace it with renewable energies. China had 57,7% of their energy created by coal in 2019, an energy source that was declared dead already during the 80s. ​So the share price is historically cheap, the world will take a long time to move away from ICE and even longer to replace plastics.

I don’t think fossil fuels will go away anytime in the next 50 yrs, but I have a feeling the world is ready to move on. Green energy isn’t as perfect as everyone wants to think and a good example of that, to some extent, is Texas and parts of the Midwest right now that are reliant on solar and wind energy to power its electricity grid. Going back to the fossil fuels, I have a gut feeling we’re going to see the same phenomenon we have with big box retailers and department stores where an inherent negative premium is priced against the related stocks regardless of current and imminent performance due to a believe the industry is inherently doomed. There was a time starting like 5 years ago where every big box retailer and department started trading at an average of 25-30% of tangible value and implied dcf valuation.

Texas is exactly what happens when you design a grid on cost and not reliability.When nuclear plants are running they are running at their maximum energy output roughly 92-93% of the time. It's by far the most reliable. By comparison wind turbines output their maximum on average around 34% of the time and solar only supplies it's maximum output around 25% of the time. No amount of innovation in their design will change that the sun sets everyday and sometimes wind doesn't blow. A 100% efficient solar panel will still only produce it's max capacity 25% of the time. Designing a system and hoping that someone comes up with a solution to energy storage issues to make it viable is not a practical idea.Decentralization of the energy grid will one day be a reality, but not soon. Solar and wind are too unpredictable and energy storage isn't there yet. As they become larger shares of energy production, the unpredictability becomes more expensive to cover. A 15% swing in energy production in a large solar farm requires a proportionally larger number of solar panels to cover than it would to cover the variability in a small solar farm. Not to mention geographic issues that comes with solar and wind. New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the South can't survive off solar or wind.While our energy needs will change a lot, the EIA creates yearly assessments projecting energy consumption until 2050 and beyond. 85% of all nuclear plants (including those from the 70's and 80's) were built in less than 10 years. If they use a pre-licensed design it's 5 years or even less. It is well within our ability to predict energy needs and plan that far ahead."

That is maybe one of the biggest investor myths of all time. It is very loosely correlated with inflation. That is why it is likely not behaving as you expect during the inflation narrative.Gold IS correlated with real treasury rates. Since the 10 year yields are increasing it will be bad for gold. If the Fed comes in and starts buying the long-end of the yield curve to suppress rates, then that will be good for gold. The rising 10 year yields from 0.4% to 1.3% is why gold has been stagnant / declining."

Just remember there's no net under it. If we all chose to we could instantly devalue it. There's no machines to liquidate, no buildings to sell and no jewelers that will buy it if we stop valuing it. It's an experiment to see if we can build a currency not based on bonds, or debt but reliability. The last part means it is so important for the price to stop fluctuating before it can be used for it's purpose. It's dream use is to be used by the stock market for moving stocks. It is perfect for that in a way gold never could be. But for that to happen it needs to stop being a speculation vehicle. We got the plane in the air but can it survive the landing, or like I said, will it be the model T and we wonder why people would get inside that without a seatbelt.
