The wider cryptocurrency sphere however, smart contracts, blockchain, DeFi, asset tokenization, economic experiments (e.g. Ampleforth). The goal of much of crypto is to reduce transactional friction. Just like we went from paper share certificates to immobilization and the DTC, there is the potential to make transactions easier by allowing for the exchange of assets without moving the underlyings. 
An immutable ledger can be quite useful. Once something is posted to the network, it's there forever. It's written in stone. Let's say you own a company and you need to keep track of all the shareholders. You could use a Google Spreadsheet, but you could get hacked or a malicious actor could change the record. You could use Computershare but that's an added cost. OTOH with a blockchain you could create a token to represent the shares of your company. With a smart contract you still have the ability to do things like approve or deny share transfers, if you want to exercise RoFR for example. You can hold votes over the network. All of this is public and permanent, so everyone involved can be assured that the records are true.
Tbh, crypto doesn't solve nearly as many problems as you would be lead to believe, and centralization is preferable in many instances. There are some really cool use cases but I don't really buy the decentralization and democratization spiel.
The more decentralized a network is, the more inefficient it becomes. This makes it difficult to scale and achieve a practical rate of transactions. This is because transactions have to sync to a majority of nodes, which are located across the world. It is not even as decentralized as it appears to be. Most of the miners and mining equipment manufacturers are Chinese, a few large mining pools dominate, critical infrastructure is run by a few companies (e.g. Infura), in all but the largest coins, it is possible to revise transactions if you can amass enough computing power (only for proof of work coins ofc.).
This is because the security of the network is derived from the computing power of the miners. More computing power -> harder to solve the cryptographic puzzles -> harder for one entity to control the network. The nature of the cryptographic puzzles is that they are hard to solve but easy to verify. Every block mined is a race, the first miner to solve the puzzle gets to decide which transactions go inside the block, and the solution is based on the transactions that are in the block and the previous block.
It's like a contest where the contestants have to come up with a coherent story of exactly 552 words without using any vowels other than ""e"". First one gets a prize. And then the next round is to come up with a sequel to the first story but this time it has to be exactly [random number] * 552 words and the only vowel you can use is ""i"". Easy to verify, hard to do.
Wow this was a ramble but hopefully it was somewhat helpful.",,

This is the latest UBM post. Notice that there is no Value Area listed. I think this is where my question is coming in. UBM said in a post that calculating the Value Area is a manual task for him and to not expect it on the daily post.
Hopefully you'll understand why I was asking if I could just use his daily post to approximate the value areas by using 1sd. You told me that's not possible. Fair enough. That leads to questions:
If his spreadsheet doesn't have the Value Area listed, then what are the deviations actually used for? I'm sure it's useful info, but are there trading strategies used for just SD?
I have your script running on my home machine, and it works fine. However, I'm never home - always on mobile. Using your script, could I perhaps pull the VAH, TOC, and VAL out and have them automatically dump into Excel? I could then set up a macro to send that sheet to me daily. The end goal is to have the Value Area figures with me on mobile (I can manually draw it into my ToS app daily. No big deal.)

Deviations can give you a clue how far it might go and whether it'd be better to jump in or fade...In any case, both pieces of info help give you context to what the market is doing.
In regards to the script and the manual entries, the script will give you the VA/POCs automatically but can change slightly depending on what timeframe your chart is on.

One-timeframing (D/W/M):    All OTing up
Comments:   ""Tuesday's session opens with an 8 point true gap higher relative to Friday's buying spike (I don't consider Monday's shortened day a true RTH session). An open above above a buying spike is typically the most bullish scenario as it indicates an extreme imbalance to the buy-side and that prices are unfair (or undervalued) relative to the range that the spike broke out of and even the prices within the spike. However, it can also indicate buyer overextension if price isn't able to be sustained above the open, which is what happened today.
A period briefly tested above the open before driving lower and filling the daily gap by B period, but buyers were found within Friday's buying spike and caused a reversal back towards the open. C period opened and immediately tested the A period high, where a relatively large seller would not let price bid above 3945, creating a poor high. This led to a new rotation lower, with F period briefly testing below Friday's buying spike base (3919.75), where price was rejected.
With the lows rejected, buyers should've had the confidence to target the highs, but price was unable to find much of any acceptance above Friday's RTH high (3935) following multiple attempts in I/J/K periods. Price closed still within the buying spike and just inside the previous 5 day balance high (3926).""
Daily Volume:   1.42m (avg/unchanged)
Volume Average (20):    1.45m
VA Placement (H/OL-H/L/OL-L/Unch):  Higher
VA Width (Wide/Avg/Narrow): Average
Directional Performance Relationship:   Strong
Comments:   Value migrates higher with very little overlap with the previous 5 day balance range of last week. Although sellers were mostly in control during RTH, price still built strong acceptance within Friday's buying spike, which is bullish for trend continuation and validation of the breakout from balance.
Tomorrow's Expectation: ""The breakout attempt from last week's balance area is still valid for the time being, but buyers will need to continue to reject any attempts below Friday's spike base (3919.75). If sellers are able to establish acceptance below this level, price is likely to revert to the balance VPOC (3909), and could continue to the balance VAL (3893).
Further acceptance within/above the buying spike is a good sign for buyers and the possibility of new ATHs will increase if buyers can repair today's poor high (3945), as short covering could lead to increased buyer momentum.""",,

https://imgur.com/a/KSswtQ6
​
The net result of this is a realized loss over $3k, and I still do not have the ability to trade in the account at this time.
For those uninformed: 
I use AMP futures, and pay for Sierra Chart 5 + Denali data package (uses TT-Fix connection).
I was -8 short ES going into 1pm close yesterday, by 6pm restart it appeared as -10 short. Around 11pm , AMP sent me an email stating that everything was fixed and that I should be able to trade my account without problems. My account said I was only -3 short, and that it had closed 7 (5 real + 2 phantom orders) contracts at a price not currently available (they retroactively closed the positions for a loss).
AMP basically told me that everything was correct, and there is nothing they can do about it short of escalating to a manager in the morning...
So I flattened the remaining contracts (-3) and went to bed...
When I woke up, it said I was short -1 from 3946 and refused to flatten the position. Eventually the flatten button worked, but immediately appeared as -2 short from 3948...
Then I received the first email from AMP stating that they were having issues with TT again...
After 1 hour I was able to flatten the -2 position, at which point, AMP sent out a second email for the day stating their intention to disable ALL trades on TT and to close all open/pending CME positions.
Both AMP and Sierra Chart have been next to useless in explaining the situation at hand, you can scroll through sierra chart support boards to see the dozens of complaints or my post history to see some of the quotes from the trade desk at AMP (yes, they eventually answered the phone after 1.5 hours of calling, only to tell me to fuck off and wait patiently for the dicking of a lifetime).
As of the close at 4:15 I still had 1 phantom contract short at 3946, which has now disappeared from SC after the 6pm reset (along with $3,000 from my margin balance).
I no longer have any confidence that the numbers or trades that appear on my console/screen are real when using Sierra Chart/Denali exchange.
Stay safe out there folks...",,

A government can marginally restrict access, or even make possession illegal, but it cannot make something of value demanded by a broad and disparate group of people magically go away. When the U.S. made the private ownership of gold illegal in 1933, gold did not lose its value or disappear as a monetary medium. It actually increased in value relative to the dollar, and just thirty years later, the ban was lifted.
Not only does bitcoin provide a greater value proposition relative to any other good that any government has ever attempted to ban (including gold); but by its nature, it is also far harder to ban. Bitcoin is global and decentralized. It is without borders and it is secured by nodes and cryptographic keys.
The act of banning bitcoin would require preventing open-source software code from being run and preventing digital signatures (created by cryptographic keys) from being broadcast on the internet. And it would have to be coordinated across numerous jurisdictions, except there is no way to know where the keys actually reside or to prevent more nodes from popping up in different jurisdictions.
Setting aside the constitutional issues, it would be technically infeasible to enforce a ban of bitcoin in any meaningful way.",,

Rule#1 of technology commercialization: You don't show off the secret sauce. Especially, if the process (not the product) isn't patented yet.
I find it hard to believe that despite EH having working prototypes in the field, there isn't ongoing production somewhere.  I'm sure there are political shenanigan's going on with the CCP, but this factory claim thing is all sorts of bad faith misrepresentation of a company probably protecting their intellectual property.
Source: I work at firm that creates new materials. We screen off entire portions of our industrial area, and limit access before showing around investors or visitors as a risk mitigation procedure. Often the equipment itself isn't specialized, and you're protecting the process to avoid potential intellectual property theft. Workers are kept away to avoid unwanted intrusions and not interfere with the sales pitch. This can create the impression that nothing is happening.",,

More than one-third of the Corn Belt in the Midwest—nearly 100 million acres—has completely lost its carbon-rich topsoil, according to University of Massachusetts Amherst research that indicates the U.S. Department of Agricultural has significantly underestimated the true magnitude of farmland erosion.
Thaler and his colleagues estimate that erosion of the A-horizon has reduced corn and soybean yields by about 6%, leading to nearly $3 billion in annual economic losses for farmers across the Midwest.
The A-horizon has primarily been lost on hilltops and ridgelines, which indicates that tillage erosion—downslope movement of soil by repeated plowing—is a major driver of soil loss in the Midwest. Notably, tillage erosion is not included in national assessments of soil loss

Maybe that should be included... 
Selling AG has always been one of my favorite trades but I think it might be too dangerous these days. Possible generational bottom IMO.",,

If you can't use cash to grow your company or earnings and need to stuff it in some asset... you're company is pretty much worthless at this point.

Uğur Şahin (BionTech CEO) already stated that he was surprised that the EU (von der Leyen)  did order only few vaccines, and very late at that too.
Here is an interview in ""Der Spiegel"" in german: https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/stimmen-zum-impfstoffmangel-ein-grobes-versagen-der-verantwortlichen-a-1196d9bf-5cd0-4b14-9a05-4706061e1331
some translations fro the web:

Uğur Şahin, Founder and the head of the German biotech firm, claims the vaccination programme in the EU ""certainly did not go as fast and smooth as it did with other countries"".   
He also explained that the gap has been caused as the EU wrongfully assumed that several Other vaccines would be ready for approval by this time. ""The assumption was that many other companies would come up with their vaccines,"" he said. ""It would seem that the impression was: ‘We’ll get enough, it won’t be so bad, and we have this under control.’ It surprised me.""

Then the whole drama about AstraZenica, turns out that they're selling their vaccine non-profit and really do not want to take responsibility for side effects (who would make no profit and take all the risk?), politicians pretended the problems stem from AZ, until the contract was released..
Germany/EU fucked that one up big time IMO.
One would assume that having the company (Biontech/Pfizer) that was first that had a working vaccine out on your soil would get you extra motivated to get as much as possible (should be easier to get to it right?), but that did not happen.
There is enough anti-vaxxers in Germany so this didn't blow up (yet?), politicians pretend that the problem is the lack willingness of people getting vaccinated.
There is a lot of weird things going regarding the pandemic and how its handled IMO.
Here in Bavaria its compulsory  to wear a FFP2/N95/KN95 mask when in public spaces, ie. shopping, public transport etc., unless you work in a shop, then you can even wear a coffee filter (seen that) instead.
My original projection was that in June/July the whole situation would have been under control, no more lockdowns etc.,  however, no real progress was made.

I made it clear that I did not make any of those trades, he told me he understands but that is what TT is telling AMP.
That’s it.

So... in a BTC world, people and companies would still have to leave money with banks because there's not enough on-chain tx room.  If those banks fail, it'd be game over.  No brrr and everyones screwed.  It actually doesn't matter if you hold on or off chain... there would be enough off chain in banks that the whole system would get wrecked.  But this would be worldwide, and not limited to the US.  Its gets better... no brrr, no bailouts means no electricity because the electricity company isn't paid and can't afford to keep the power going without paying employees or buying material.  No electricity means no mining and no bitcoin.  So no money. Worldwide. We'd be back in the stone age had we been on a BTC standard and something like 2008 happened.  Even if some miners manage to stay online, the internet switches would be turned off and they'd be isolated and most people wouldn't even be able to check a balance let alone make a transaction.
But a little brrr and problem gets solved.",,

Btw... you do need to be a bit careful if intentionally shorting vol.

And sometimes MMs do have it mispricex and it'll blow through a couple sigmas quickly.  I wouldn't ever sell vol on meme stocks for example, its just too unpredictable lol. When I short it, it's in the context of IV being a lot higher than historical vol and there is not a binary event (like earnings) which would account to for that elevated pricing. Basically, historical vol is like fair value and IV is what you're paying.  And its not like equities where value can be divorced from fundamentals for some time... it'll pay (or not) by expiration if fundamentals are off.

If you're short vol, you would generally want to be delta/gamma neutral. If you're not delta neutral, you're kind of dealing with second level derivatives and have to monitor DdeltaDvol, otherwise known as vanna. Reduce the amount of influence the Greeks can have on your position and you have less factors to worry about.
A true vol play would only care about two things, vega and theta. Theta eats into your profits if you're trying to long vol but didn't time it well, theta is your friend if you're short vol. Vega increasing is bad if you're short vol, good if you're long.
u/rs6866 outlined some good strategies you can use, but I would consider those plays long vol since they benefit from a rise in volatility. Just do the exact reverse of what he said to be short vol.  
This would be ala short strangle and straddle, long calendars, short iron condors and butterflies, and if you want directional bias, short call and put spreads (but ratioed for your delta bias), and jade lizard.
Just try to keep your strategies simple and easy to understand. Once they get complicated, it's hard to figure out how the math can turn against you and how to exit with your shirt on. Also, I try to not do plays that require positions in different expirations, the probability calculators tend to not be able to price those positions very well (other than calendars, you should be able to do that math on your own).

It seems like this rise in yields in response to reflation and possibly lower solvency risk in risk assets but it seems unclear to me as to what effect these treasuries have on the cost of debt in the economy . i.e. is this less important than the fed raising the fed funds rate.
The relationship between bonds and equities seems very strange at times, on one hand low yields indicate cheap debt which props companies up yet on the other hand higher yields indicate movement back into risk assets. Not really sure how to read this recent movement.",,

In the summer, yes it may be 100 deg outside, but at 70deg inside delta T is 30 degrees.  Insulation and delta T determine how much heat is transfered, A/C makes up this difference.
Now, much of texas has temperatures in the 20's or lower.  Delta T is now 50+ degrees (40+ if inside temp is reduced to 60F).  With the same insulation, almost 2x the heat has to be moved to maintain temperatures.  I'd wager that most of texas uses heat pumps (run your a/c in reverse to move heat from outside to inside).  Unfortunately... most heat pumps don't really work well when the temperature falls under freezing, and especially if snow gets on the consensor coils (which really run as evaporators when in heat pump mode) outside.  If the heat pump fails, the difference is made up with resistive heating, which is 3-4x less efficient.  So, people with heat pumps need roughly 6-8x the electricity to heat their house in these temperatures than to cool their house in 100 deg heat.
Assume some gas makes up the difference... maybe the power demand is still 3-5x.  That's still going to be way above grid capacity.",,

In the opposite case in the winter, a heat pump is trying to transfer heat from the outside (below freezing), which is inefficient due to details about the boiling and condensation point of the working fluid that accomplishes this heat transfer.

I suspect the maturation of physically settled Bitcoin derivatives markets is the root cause of this situation.  If true, does this cause a growing incentive structure to lock-up coins in a net-neutral way & drive the price to hyperbitcoinization.

The fact that you could immediately end up down $50 on a pair of /MES going against you by 5 handles was hard to handle because that was an immediate 1% off the account (started small) but then looking at exits, percent risked vs percent reward, made it a lot easier...and I think makes it a lot easier to scale.

Yeah though... that's one of the big issues with renewables such as solar/wind.  They can't easily be scaled up/down with demand.  I've said it for years... but as great of an idea as it is to harness these types of power sources (and they do have their place!), we will not eliminate carbon until we move to a nuclear-powered economy.  Nukes or carbon, you have to pick one.  When politicans say they're for eliminating CO2 emission, but won't consider nuke power, I honestly can't take them seriously.
As a side note... if the government did with fusion power what they did with the moon race in the 60's, we'd absolutely accomplish it in 1-2 decades.  The materials are close, the science is close, but we need to get good, hard data from larger scale reactors.  It would also spur a materials revolution in the same way the space race did.  It's within reach to have a large capacity/excess of 0 emission (other than helium) power which we could sell to other countries to offset the taxpayer funded R&D.  Cheap power across the country would also be a huge benefit to Americans who'd see their power bill drop, and would allow manufacturing to flourish here, bringing jobs.

Borrowing money for the carry cost for one.

Let's make an assumption we're treating this as some type of FI replacement.  It's appears super low risk (assuming you close at or near expiration), so imagine it as a lowish yield but high probability profit to your target.  

Transaction fees. Risk of transaction fees spiking, see dec 2017. Although that wasn't crazy high or anything... but what if a sell-off occurs and on-chain transactions require $1000 fees?

Ohh this would be spicy indeed, but is there any historical context for a spike to be nearly this high?  Remember I'm talking about literally just arbing the futures calendars (cme direct products, not touching the underlying on some other exchange, so.. just cme fees)

Bid-ask spread differential.

If I go to TV and plot the difference between the front month and second to front month, I get this.  This is for buying the back and selling the front.
On a cursory glance, it appears the spread is widening.  If you sell the back and buy the front you get blown out.  Selling the front and buying the back is what's profitable.  But it wasn't always profitable... sometimes it went down.
So to test my thesis and see if this has to do with the borrowing cost, I'm going to normalize this difference by the cost of BTC.  If BTC's price goes up, the spread should widen as the carrying cost will also go up.  Testing this... I get this plot, which is much more stable over time.  Not perfect, but much better.",,

Alright... let's do the math here.  As far as borrowing, I was referring to the OP's trade... buy physical bitcoin and short the futures.  Collect the spread.  The /btc futures contract is for 5 coins.  So you'd need to borrow $200k, buy 5 coins with it, and short the futures price.  If you assume 5% APY interest on the loan (this isn't exactly a mortgage with a physical asset the bank can take over), for 1/4 year that'd be 1.2% interest.  1.2% of 200k is ~$2024, or almost entirely the difference between futures and physical.  So that indeed accounts for most of the differential.  If you tried to do a calendar on futures contracts alone, that differential should hold over the life of the contract.

Ohh this would be spicy indeed, but is there any historical context for a spike to be nearly this high?

There's not.  But... institutions and hedge funds are in the mix now with billions at stake.  If this run-up does indeed proove to be a bubble and a selloff gets sparked, liquidity is bought in BTC by increasing transaction fees.  Blocks occur every 10 min... so if you miss a block as price is in freefall, you're left holding the buck longer.  How much do you think HF's and institutions will be willing to put as a tx  fee to get out?  I could easily see it going to 1k, 10k, or even 100k if it means the difference in billions in profit for them.  The guy who'll get stuck holding the buck is the retail investor with a physical wallet who can't afford to compete with HF's when there's a premium put on liquidity.",,

You're plotting the rolling front vs back month, and not the individual legs of the past during expirations.  Try it with dates in the past, say Dec '20 vs Feb '21.  You should see the convergence close to 0 (around dec expiration).
Note, it does not necessarily mean it will converge to actual 0, but the logic is mostly there.

When I look at the SPX, I am the first one to admit that we look very overextended. And by looking at this, I would get emotional and want to short this market because surely it can’t go up forever, right? I mean, we had green days in a row and then 3 flat days of consolidation. At some point we have to pullback.
This pullback doesn’t HAVE to come, but if it does, it is still at least 150pts away. I will lay out my bullish thesis below, and the reason I remain long and shall continue rolling calls:
---------------------
Instead of looking at SPY to predict what direction the market will move, we must look at the components of the market. Let’s start with healthcare.

IHE is breaking out of SEVEN YEAR BASE. The rally in pharmaceuticals is merely beginning, and I am a big breakout buyer. This thing will, at a minimum, double over the next few years.
Let’s look at another more popular ETF- the XLV. If we believe that the big October run was the pole of a bull flag and then the flag was formed from 11/9 to 11/30, then we must replicate the bull flag breakout in both time and price. The breakout target for XLV is $122.19, which WE HAVE YET TO REACH. Although we can see again that from 1/27 to 2/11 we were yet again consolidating for a breakout https://imgur.com/a/tYPRYF6. Again, this is HIGHLY BULLISH and I am a breakout buyer.

If healthcare moves higher, the market cannot crash.
----------------- 
Next, I would like to look at transports. For this, I have selected the IYT, the Dow Jones Transport ETF. The IYT is BREAKING OUT OF A FIVE YEAR BASE! I am again a buyer of this technical breakout.
This is a majorly rock hard bullish sign, as transports are often viewed as a leading signal for the economy. Which by the way, is indicative of the move in bonds we are currently seeing. Morgan Stanley agrees that yield strength is driven on the back of an improving economic backdrop.
If you are a believer in Dow Theory, this is another bullish sign.
----------------- 
Next I would like to discuss energy stocks.
/CL is one of the most bullish technical setups I can currently find. It is constantly bull flagging into a breakout. Then another bull flag into a breakout. If we are to believe Friday’s move was a true technical breakout, then we must respect the equal legs principal and complete an equal move in both time and price. We should see /CL trading at $63.77 by 2/23, which is next Tuesday.
https://imgur.com/a/nvVKDGY
A break of $63 on a weekly chart would also confirm the commodity supercyle that many strategists have been predicting. IMO we are FAR from the peak of crude oil demand given the wide array of petro uses in our daily lives, and this goes far beyond transportation

XLE should breakout above its June high and should target $51, which is the bull flag target of the December low.
I am also long KMI strictly because it a related energy name with the lowest implied vol in the sector. This is my largest position via calls. KMI should also target $16 in the next 2-3 weeks. Then $20s this summer.

Gas prices are rising. Energy stocks are expected to have EPS increases of up to 600% this year. The market cannot crash when these backbone stocks rally.
----------------- 
I would like to discuss real estate stocks.

The IYR is the widely used REIT ETF, which has already broken above its June high. If we are to believe that the consolidation from June to October was a giant bull flag, then the next equal legs bull flag target is $93.
But… we already have confirmation that the REIT ETF is going higher since we also look at its components. SPG is one of the top holdings and it is breaking out even after bad FFO earnings. It is now on track to fill the March gap.

Look at housing prices! They are through the roof. The market cannot crash if real estate is performing well.
(I am not long any REITS, but AGNC and O have historically low IV and should follow their peers if you want to be long).
----------------- 
Now we should discuss tech stocks since this is the only sector that actually matters.

First of all, we saw some of the largest dark pool buying in tech stocks that we have seen in 11 weeks https://imgur.com/a/houLeka
But specifically I would like to touch on AMZN, which has also seen HUGE dark pool buying the past 15 trading sessions. AMZN has been a pain as it has yet to break out of this wedge, but it will pop soon. Whether that is this week or next month I am unable to predict. But it will happen.

See, we already have confirmation that AMZN will break out and lead the market to new highs. MSFT already broke out above its September highs and reached new ATHs, AAPL also went to new ATHs above its September high, and NVDA is acting as a leading indicator by also breaking out of its 6 month consolidation to brand new ATHs. 

QQQ also formed a bull flag from the March low which then consolidated from September to November. We then place the original flag pole at the breakout spot to determine the equal legs target which puts QQQ at $419 by the end of this year. And this is conservative.
NFLX is another piece of confirmation that tech will go to new ATHs. On earnings it broke out to $590 and has since backtested the breakout. THIS IS NOT BEARISH. It held and has since consolidated and is ready for the next leg higher. By applying the bull flag principal again, we are targeting mid- $800s by end of summer. Again, this is CONSERVATIVE. There was huge call buying in the June and July strikes last week. (I am long calls.)

It is silly to think that AMZN will lag while all other tech stocks rally. The market cannot crash when tech performs. In fact, when tech leads, the SPX is invincible.
----------------- 
Other factors and my beliefs:

Global Equity flows have reversed just 20% of the record outflows since 2018. This means there is a record amount of money still on the sidelines. Nice even numbers like 4000 really induce some FOMO, don’t they? IF history repeats itself, buyers may just be getting started.
JPM published a piece this weekend (unable to share due to copyright) that says they believe based on herd immunity and vaccine rates, COVID will be over in 40-70 days.
The return to VIX < 15 seems possible, and actually likely. Implied Vol is far above Realized vol as folks keep piling into upside calls. A close above 4000 will cause massive hedges to be unwound.
93% of all stocks are currently above their 200d sma. The last time this occurred was October 2009. Since then very, very good things have happened in the market. Doesn’t mean it will occur again, but this is a broad based rally and not subject to just one sector.
Far too many people do not believe in this rally and keep shorting it. The rally will end when they stop shorting it. Until then, they are the only guaranteed buyers and will keep adding momentum.
SPX 4500-4600 this summer and 5000 year-end is the most likely scenario as tech, semis, and banks rally in tandem to new ATHs.",,
