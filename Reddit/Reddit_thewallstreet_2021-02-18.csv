The wider cryptocurrency sphere however, smart contracts, blockchain, DeFi, asset tokenization, economic experiments (e.g. Ampleforth). The goal of much of crypto is to reduce transactional friction. Just like we went from paper share certificates to immobilization and the DTC, there is the potential to make transactions easier by allowing for the exchange of assets without moving the underlyings. An immutable ledger can be quite useful. Once something is posted to the network, it's there forever. It's written in stone. Let's say you own a company and you need to keep track of all the shareholders. You could use a Google Spreadsheet, but you could get hacked or a malicious actor could change the record. You could use Computershare but that's an added cost. OTOH with a blockchain you could create a token to represent the shares of your company. With a smart contract you still have the ability to do things like approve or deny share transfers, if you want to exercise RoFR for example. You can hold votes over the network. All of this is public and permanent, so everyone involved can be assured that the records are true.Tbh, crypto doesn't solve nearly as many problems as you would be lead to believe, and centralization is preferable in many instances. There are some really cool use cases but I don't really buy the decentralization and democratization spiel.The more decentralized a network is, the more inefficient it becomes. This makes it difficult to scale and achieve a practical rate of transactions. This is because transactions have to sync to a majority of nodes, which are located across the world. It is not even as decentralized as it appears to be. Most of the miners and mining equipment manufacturers are Chinese, a few large mining pools dominate, critical infrastructure is run by a few companies (e.g. Infura), in all but the largest coins, it is possible to revise transactions if you can amass enough computing power (only for proof of work coins ofc.).This is because the security of the network is derived from the computing power of the miners. More computing power -> harder to solve the cryptographic puzzles -> harder for one entity to control the network. The nature of the cryptographic puzzles is that they are hard to solve but easy to verify. Every block mined is a race, the first miner to solve the puzzle gets to decide which transactions go inside the block, and the solution is based on the transactions that are in the block and the previous block.It's like a contest where the contestants have to come up with a coherent story of exactly 552 words without using any vowels other than e. First one gets a prize. And then the next round is to come up with a sequel to the first story but this time it has to be exactly [random number] * 552 words and the only vowel you can use is i. Easy to verify, hard to do.Wow this was a ramble but hopefully it was somewhat helpful."

Price initially tested lower, but rotated through the opening price multiple times in the morning periods, making it an open-auction type of open. A/B period formed a developing poor high when buyers were unable to find continuation above 2/12's buying spike base (3919.75), causing a rotation lower in C/D/E periods. However, sellers weren't able to make a new low and lost momentum themselves below 3900.F period began one timeframing higher and buyers didn't look back, repairing the developing poor high in J period and building acceptance back within yesterday's range.Daily Volume:   1.35m (unchanged/slightly lower)Volume Average (20):    1.45mVA Placement (H/OL-H/L/OL-L/Unch):  TPO VA = lower, Volume VA = OL-LowerVA Width (Wide/Avg/Narrow): AverageDirectional Performance Relationship:   Balancing, weakeningComments:   dVPOC migrates higher at/after close to 3928 from 3908, giving validation to the prices traded in today's range extension above IBH. However, value by time (TPO VA) remained lower. This is notable because time is the great market regulator, 70%+ of today's session was spent lower relative to yesterday and inside an established balance area. Therefore we will need to see confirmation of these higher prices with further acceptance by time (TPOs).Tomorrow's Expectation: With buyers failing to sustain higher prices above the previous balance area and value migrating lower, the breakout attempt to the upside is in danger of failing. However, upon re-entering last week's balance range, sellers should've had the strength to test the balance low (3878.25) or at the least balance VAL (3893), neither of which were reached.This makes tonight's ETH session and tomorrow open even more important, with the key levels to be watch being the balance high (3926) and the 2/12 spike base (3919.75). The area between these two prices has relatively low composite volume levels, meaning these prices have been deemed unfair and have a higher chance of being rejected either from above or below. If price opens above 3926, and price acceptance is established above today's RTH high (3930), first target should be 2/16's VAH (3937.5) then repairing the poor high (3945). An open below 3920 will put us back within last week's balance, and thus rejecting today's buyer extension. I would expect price to explore lower in this case, first targeting balance VPOC (3909), then today's RTH low (3896.5). The last scenario is for price to balance between 3926 and 3919.75, in which case it'd probably be best to wait for a new direction be established"

Online retail topped CNY122B, with catering sales surging 135% compared with the Spring Festival holiday last year as more Chinese ordered ready-to-eat meals through e-commerce or online food delivery platforms.   The story noted many places across China have encouraged residents and migrant workers to stay put for the festival to reduce people traffic and curb the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Recall earlier press discussions warned of volatility in China data over Q1 mainly due to base effects from the initial coronavirus shock last year.

Theres a lot of money in bond markets and a lot of the big money there is smarter than I am when it comes to this stuff.  Bond market is still saying inflation.  That should really make everyone, including the fed, cautious.  In 2018 the bond market priced in cuts while the fed was still saying raise.  Bond market was right.  Not that they'll always be right... but when lots of expert analysts say its getting ahead of itself and there's no risk, it honestly brings back flashbacks of 2018 when they said the same things about it pricing in cuts while everyone was saying the rates were going up.  If those analysts were actually good, they'd be advisors for multi billion dollar bond funds... not people giving their opinions away to the public for free.  Again... it may all change and they could be wrong, but im gonna be cautious at least until its clear they're not."

This follows similar announcements from Samsung/Infineon, which closed down facilities in the Austin area. NXP operates three front end fabs in the US (third in Chandler, Arizona) with two international (Singapore, the Netherlands) and we estimate shutdown could impact ~40% of internal front end capacity or 20% of total capacity (we est. NXP manufactures 50% internally). Importantly, NXP's Austin Oak Hill fab is its only internal source of sensors and HDTMOS (high density transition metal oxide semis), while the Austin Ed Bluestein fab is its only internal source of Advanced CMOS and SoCs.   While it is difficult to quantify the true risk since length of shutdown is unknown and NXP will likely shift capacity to other internal or external fabs, it is worth noting that shutting down semi manufacturing even for a short time can incur millions of dollars in losses due to scale and complexity of operations. Plus, even if supply normalizes in 1-2 weeks, it could take 1-2 months to see full utilization at a fab given 40-50 days' long chip fabrication cycle time. Still we expect disruptions to be resolved within Q1, and therefore leave full year estimates unchanged.Closures could escalate auto chip capacity shortages  This unusual and unexpected winter storm in Texas could exacerbate global shortage for auto semiconductors. NXP is the largest supplier of automotive semis with Infineon as a close second; the two companies combined control ~20% of all auto semi chip output globally. Therefore, any extended shutdown could have significant impacts on auto chip capacity which is already extraordinarily tight. Indeed, last qtr NXP channel inventory fell to 5+ year low of 1.6 months, well below normal range of 2.2-2.5 months, and NXP had no expectation that it would be able to fill in the channel during Q1 (would ship for production). Chip shortages have had significant consequences including forcing auto OEMs like GM, Ford, VW and Subaru to close down production, with IHS estimating production impact could reach ~900K vehicles (or 1-2% of global production) in 2021.TXN, QRVO internal capacity also in Texas  We also highlight risks to semi peers that operate facilities in Texas including TXN (all internal 300mm or 12 capacity used for analog chips) and QRVO (IDP and BAW, the latter critical for 5G smartphones). MCHP, on the other hand, operates in Arizona and therefore could be more insulated from supply disruptions in Texas. We note production risks in Texas could lead more customers to take advantage of MCHP Preferred Supplier Program (which prioritizes capacity to customers that can provide non-cancellable 12 mo purchase commitments) which would improve visibility and allow for better planning of capacity utilization. Japanese semi chip peers are likely more prepared for these black swan events since they learned from similar disruptions post the 2011 earthquake.Closures emphasize need for diversification, +ve semicaps  High concentration of semiconductor manufacturing fabs in Texas illustrates risks to production from lack of geographic diversification. This further emphasizes our positive view on our favored semicap sector (AMAT, KLAC, LRCX), which will benefit from capacity additions and fab diversification."

I do agree with the supply vs demand issue we're about to see and making inflation. I hadn't considered that it could be temporary... and thats a valid point.  The risk though is a temporary burst makes more companies raise prices in anticipation.  And if everyone does this a little more than necessary, it could snowball and be like a self-fufilling prophecy.  Prices going up because people and companies expect them to and act accordingly. For what its worth... I was reading on Bloomberg 2021 predictions from a bunch of firms made at the end of last year.  Its funny how in 1.5 months so many large institutions could be wrong.  On equity fronts some were saying 3850 wouldn't be breached on SPX until the 2nd half of 2021.  Rates wise, almost every firm (with the exception of Morgan Stanley) said year end target was 1.25 or less for the 10y.  Year end.  It hit 1.3 yesterday.  MS may have missed other predictions but if they got rates better than anyone, I'd be more inclined to believe their inflation expectations.We will certainly see a spike in the numbers.  Some might be fake due to rolling of of these deflationary months from the 12 mo average, some might be real but temporary, and some might be real and more permanent.  It may be hard to see the forest from the treas this year."

Reason why - I trade from my little basement by myself (i'm a retail pajama trader) and have no one to talk to besides you folks.  I lean on this sub to help me through the good and bad times.  While you'll often see me humble-bragging on my big wins, I often lose too.  I talk alot about how i'm quantitative, follow a set of predefined rules, backtest/forward test everything, etc.. Even to us algo traders , there is always bias.  Either bias in your data, bias in your parameters, bias in the general regime you think things are moving, bias in literally everything.  One major goal (for me anyway) is to remove as much bias as possible.  I don't think it's entirely doable but I should be able to mitigate my bias by decoupling my personal thoughts as much as possible in my trades.  That's the entire purpose of why I trade through software - once I start mashing on keys and making decisions based on hand drawn lines on a chart (that haven't gone through any quantitative analysis); I'll start fucking up. Today I fucked up.   I hit my max daily allowed loss, -2k, the bots shut themselves down.  Basically told me to sit in a corner until tomorrow.  I got angry.  Irrationally angry.  Thinking I knew better I tried manually (discretionary) short scalping /NQ to try and reduce my losses.  It went great in the beginning, I actually erased all of the loss and had +100 bucks in my PnL!  So I continued, hoping to actually make some real money.   Guess what, the price popped up and blew me out again.  -2.4k.  I did it again, sold /NQ at the top of todays VA, covered it at vwap and reduced my loss, way back down to just -500!  But what if we would have continued up and through yesterdays VA?  I would have been sitting at like a -5k+ loss , wiping out huge amounts of my gains for the week.I've said this before but I'll say it one more time.  If not for the newcomers, then for myself as a reminder that I need to practice what I preach.Don't look at your PnL. Don't look at your PnL. Don't look at your PnLAlways enter AND exit with a plan.Don't chase. Don't fomoDon't look at your PnLDon't manually trade.  Ever.  (for myself specifically, not exclusive to everyone here)"

Here's what the footprint looks like at today's developing high: https://imgur.com/a/OVulnP7Notice how there's still some absorption from sellers (as evidenced by the green Cum. delta by price above 3918) but more importantly, volume tapers off at the highs, unlike yesterday, as buyers aren't interested in initiating new activity up there. There was also a poor high in the ETH session that I would characterize as a natural poor high.Just an interesting nuance that I'll be carrying forward. Successive lower poor highs tells me that responsive sellers are stronger than initiative buyers right now and until those buyers return, lower prices should be expected. Repairing the developing poor high today would be a good indication of this and could target yesterday's VPOC (3931)."

Its printing/generating value without actually creating any real value.It consumes energy and creates no value other than the value of itself.Its extremely exploitative of earth's resources. It doesn't motivate bitcoin holders to produce and generate value for society. Most people need to work at jobs, otherwise nothing would work. You would not get water to your house, no food, no heat, no electricity, no delivery, no phone support, no cops, no governence etc. Bitcoin does the opposite of making people work at jobs. BTC is a scam that exists to harm earth and people. Its like a religion but for money. Its like the salesman who's selling you lands in heaven 1500 years ago. BTC is essentially a virus. It exists just to exist by consuming everything else (electricity, minerals, attention and opportunity cost of human labor and/or lack thereof).Bitcoin is only good for AI evolution (and maybe that scammy salesman). The more it grows, the faster AI can evolve enough to gain power over humans"

I'd like to offer a different perspective to get your thoughtsIn terms of natural and artificial poor high, is it not enough for price to have printed the way it did on the MP regardless of how they were filled? The scenario is the same, buyers stepped into a scenario where momentum did not carry into new highs but price spent enough time there to leave the poor high print. There was enough interest at those prices that an excess was not formed (an excess being a visual confirmation that an auction has seen its high).Which leads me to your thought here Successive lower poor highs tells me that responsive sellers are stronger than initiative buyers right now and until those buyers return, lower prices should be expected. Wouldn't looking at this kind of structure from this perspective serve more as hindsight than anything else? It makes more sense to use it as a forward looking signal. That at poor highs and poor lows there is an unfinished auction in search of excess. Meaning the odds are higher that price will seek to finish the auction (form an excess) at some point in the near future due to unmet demand from an auctions perspective.Anyone is welcome to come @ me on this lmao just my thoughts"

I see inflation as a risk because of supply side shortfalls due to covid, but demand side stimulus.  Companies (supply) were given loans, and many still ended up closing.  People (demand) were given free money with no repayment demands, and many don't need it.  People's bank accounts are now bulging, and they're waiting to reopen to go on a spending spree.  Meanwhile companies will struggle to produce enough to satisfy demand, and will have to find capital (raise prices) to repay loans.  On top of that, congress is pushing for $15 min wage, which will further fuel demand while forcing prices to increase more to cover the additional wage costs.  Commodities (raw materials) are sky rocketing, as many supply side shortfalls still exist and will for the forseeable future.  Price is determined by supply and demand.  Brrrring doesn't (always) break supply and demand.  Our response to covid did."

The links I pasted above are what I'd consider the easy part of all this, anyone can read and learn. Learning the more in-depth stuff around specific topics is harder, but I have a bunch of books (willing to share some recommendations if you need).Once you progress, you'll find specific areas you're interested in (equity options, commodity futures, spread trades, fixed income/bonds, etc.. ).You're already well beyond alot of the intro stuff so honestly I'd pick whatever tool you already have some familiarity with (say if you use TOS, just learn thinkscript.  Or if you use IB, use their python api, etc..).  If you don't actually have a set of predefined rules , ie a strategy, then definitely start with that before learning any tech."

I mean pent up demand by people willing to accept higher prices on things too.Supply will have to raise prices to cover their new costs which include shortfalls in their supply, higher commoditiy costs, loan repayments, higher min wage, etc...Now demand-side, people have more money in their account.  They haven't gone on a vacation in over a year.  They haven't eaten out in a long time.  If prices are a bit higher, in their head it's OK... they got a bit of extra cash and looking back they haven't spent as much on those activities in a while.  But even to the effect of doing more: I'll tell you what... when FL fully reopened last summer, my family went out to eat a lot more than we did before lockdown in CT (we moved halfway through 2020).  We did rationalize it because we saved money by not going out under lockdown.  We did make up for lost time.  Maybe not everyone will... remains to be seen.

An open above above a buying spike is typically the most bullish scenario as it indicates an extreme imbalance to the buy-side and that prices are unfair (or undervalued) relative to the range that the spike broke out of and even the prices within the spike. However, it can also indicate buyer overextension if price isn't able to be sustained above the open, which is what happened today.A period briefly tested above the open before driving lower and filling the daily gap by B period, but buyers were found within Friday's buying spike and caused a reversal back towards the open. C period opened and immediately tested the A period high, where a relatively large seller would not let price bid above 3945, creating a poor high. This led to a new rotation lower, with F period briefly testing below Friday's buying spike base (3919.75), where price was rejected.With the lows rejected, buyers should've had the confidence to target the highs, but price was unable to find much of any acceptance above Friday's RTH high (3935) following multiple attempts in I/J/K periods. Price closed still within the buying spike and just inside the previous 5 day balance high (3926).Daily Volume:   1.42m (avg/unchanged)Volume Average (20):    1.45mVA Placement (H/OL-H/L/OL-L/Unch):  HigherVA Width (Wide/Avg/Narrow): AverageDirectional Performance Relationship:   StrongComments:   Value migrates higher with very little overlap with the previous 5 day balance range of last week. Although sellers were mostly in control during RTH, price still built strong acceptance within Friday's buying spike, which is bullish for trend continuation and validation of the breakout from balance.Tomorrow's Expectation: The breakout attempt from last week's balance area is still valid for the time being, but buyers will need to continue to reject any attempts below Friday's spike base (3919.75). If sellers are able to establish acceptance below this level, price is likely to revert to the balance VPOC (3909), and could continue to the balance VAL (3893).Further acceptance within/above the buying spike is a good sign for buyers and the possibility of new ATHs will increase if buyers can repair today's poor high (3945), as short covering could lead to increased buyer momentum."

Around 11pm , AMP sent me an email stating that everything was fixed and that I should be able to trade my account without problems. My account said I was only -3 short, and that it had closed 7 (5 real + 2 phantom orders) contracts at a price not currently available (they retroactively closed the positions for a loss).AMP basically told me that everything was correct, and there is nothing they can do about it short of escalating to a manager in the morning...So I flattened the remaining contracts (-3) and went to bed...When I woke up, it said I was short -1 from 3946 and refused to flatten the position. Eventually the flatten button worked, but immediately appeared as -2 short from 3948...Then I received the first email from AMP stating that they were having issues with TT again...After 1 hour I was able to flatten the -2 position, at which point, AMP sent out a second email for the day stating their intention to disable ALL trades on TT and to close all open/pending CME positions.Both AMP and Sierra Chart have been next to useless in explaining the situation at hand, you can scroll through sierra chart support boards to see the dozens of complaints or my post history to see some of the quotes from the trade desk at AMP (yes, they eventually answered the phone after 1.5 hours of calling, only to tell me to fuck off and wait patiently for the dicking of a lifetime).As of the close at 4:15 I still had 1 phantom contract short at 3946, which has now disappeared from SC after the 6pm reset (along with $3,000 from my margin balance).I no longer have any confidence that the numbers or trades that appear on my console/screen are real when using Sierra Chart/Denali exchange.Stay safe out there folks..."

Real world experience is much more valuable than cramming for the next exam.  The other side of the coin is, if he allows for a $50k write-off, for profit universities would magically increase their tuition to account for this.  I believe one of the reasons we have runaway higher-ed costs is due to the government grants that line the stadiums of these damn schools.  When anyone can go to college thanks to taking on student debt and this is the only way the majority of people can go to college and the government makes it so easy to take out grants, why shouldn't the universities increase prices.  If we provide a free alternative (community college) with STEM courses leading to accredited degrees, we can watch this stupid for profit house of cards collapse in on itself."

I wonder if the points they're deriving is through overlap of cameras.I know an issue with say visual SLAM is you normally get a super sparse feature set not to mention robust feature extraction (between frames) is often quite slow (i.e. SIFT although SURF is kinda quicker), then you try to derive the transformation between the frames. In stereo vision however, you can triangulate in 3D where a common feature is between frames knowing the exact position of each of the two cameras.Either way - TSLA doing it with raw cameras is quite impressive even if it is flawed and isn't perfect - it's very impressive compared to LIDAR versions"

It is issued and regulated by the central bank and its status as legal tender is guaranteed by the Chinese state.It is more of a replacement of the RMB currency itself, instead of just a form of payment. It will allow the state more control over its currency.

A government can marginally restrict access, or even make possession illegal, but it cannot make something of value demanded by a broad and disparate group of people magically go away. When the U.S. made the private ownership of gold illegal in 1933, gold did not lose its value or disappear as a monetary medium. It actually increased in value relative to the dollar, and just thirty years later, the ban was lifted.Not only does bitcoin provide a greater value proposition relative to any other good that any government has ever attempted to ban (including gold); but by its nature, it is also far harder to ban. Bitcoin is global and decentralized. It is without borders and it is secured by nodes and cryptographic keys.The act of banning bitcoin would require preventing open-source software code from being run and preventing digital signatures (created by cryptographic keys) from being broadcast on the internet. And it would have to be coordinated across numerous jurisdictions, except there is no way to know where the keys actually reside or to prevent more nodes from popping up in different jurisdictions.Setting aside the constitutional issues, it would be technically infeasible to enforce a ban of bitcoin in any meaningful way."

Instead, it would be the fait accompli for the fiat system. It would reinforce to the masses that bitcoin is a formidable currency, and it would set off a global and hopeless game of whack-a-mole. There is no central point of failure in bitcoin; bitcoin miners, nodes and keys are distributed throughout the world. Every aspect of bitcoin is decentralized, which is why running nodes and controlling keys is core to bitcoin. The more keys and the more nodes that exist, the more decentralized bitcoin becomes, and the more immune bitcoin is to attack. The more jurisdictions in which mining exists, the less risk any single jurisdiction represents to bitcoin’s security function. A coordinated state-level attack would only serve to build the strength of bitcoin’s immune system. It would ultimately accelerate the shift away from the legacy financial system (and legacy currencies), and it would accelerate innovation within the bitcoin economic system. With each passing threat, bitcoin innovates to immunize the threat. A coordinated state-level attack would be no different."

Not including the lobbing would happen since US companies hold over 100B in Bitcoin alone. Banning Bitcoin is a fool’s errand. Some will try; all will fail. And the very attempts to ban bitcoin will accelerate its adoption and proliferation. It will be the hundred mile-per-hour wind that fuels the wildfire. It will also make bitcoin stronger and more reliable, further immunizing it from attack and reinforcing its antifragile nature. And in any case, believing governments will ban bitcoin, if it becomes a credible threat to global reserve currencies, is an irrational reason to discount it as a savings technology.It both cedes that bitcoin is viable as money, while at the same time ignoring the principal reasons as to why: decentralization and censorship-resistance. Imagine understanding the greatest present secret in the world and not capitalizing on the asymmetry and utility that bitcoin provides in fear of government.More likely, either someone understands why bitcoin works and that it will not fail at the hands of a government, or a knowledge gap exists as to how bitcoin is able to function in the first place. Begin by understanding the fundamentals, and then apply that as a baseline to assess any potential risk posed by future government intervention or regulation. And never discount the value of asymmetry; the only winning move is to play."

There's a million and a half reasons why the facility might not be ready, or is ready but you won't be shown what's going on.Rule#1 of technology commercialization: You don't show off the secret sauce. Especially, if the process (not the product) isn't patented yet.I find it hard to believe that despite EH having working prototypes in the field, there isn't ongoing production somewhere.  I'm sure there are political shenanigan's going on with the CCP, but this factory claim thing is all sorts of bad faith misrepresentation of a company probably protecting their intellectual property.Source: I work at firm that creates new materials. We screen off entire portions of our industrial area, and limit access before showing around investors or visitors as a risk mitigation procedure. Often the equipment itself isn't specialized, and you're protecting the process to avoid potential intellectual property theft. Workers are kept away to avoid unwanted intrusions and not interfere with the sales pitch. This can create the impression that nothing is happening."

Further, VIX itself is calculated with options 24-37 DTE - the 'huge majority' of put options active on SPX are for much closer timeframes. Nevertheless, those thing miss the point - VIX can rise as calls OI increases. Further, VIX can also drop if puts are sold-to-open and depress the put price more than the OI delta (eg, MM are inelastic at those strikes). Regardless of how plausible the above scenarios are, that's how the calculations work. If they seem surprising, I'd encourage you to review the CBOE's whitepaper."

Another good item to look at is the curve as a whole, or historical spreads between rates.  For example in TV, you can plot US10Y-US02Y and look at weekly to see the ups and downs over the years.  That one usually goes negative prior to recessions and quickly goes positive when things start improving.  That's why I'm short long duration... that velocity is quick, and it looked like it was amping to go.  With the FED holding the 2y back, the only way the 10-2 runs is if the 10 goes.

The assumption was that many other companies would come up with their vaccines, he said. It would seem that the impression was: ‘We’ll get enough, it won’t be so bad, and we have this under control.’ It surprised me.Then the whole drama about AstraZenica, turns out that they're selling their vaccine non-profit and really do not want to take responsibility for side effects (who would make no profit and take all the risk?), politicians pretended the problems stem from AZ, until the contract was released..Germany/EU fucked that one up big time IMO.One would assume that having the company (Biontech/Pfizer) that was first that had a working vaccine out on your soil would get you extra motivated to get as much as possible (should be easier to get to it right?), but that did not happen.There is enough anti-vaxxers in Germany so this didn't blow up (yet?), politicians pretend that the problem is the lack willingness of people getting vaccinated.There is a lot of weird things going regarding the pandemic and how its handled IMO.Here in Bavaria its compulsory  to wear a FFP2/N95/KN95 mask when in public spaces, ie. shopping, public transport etc., unless you work in a shop, then you can even wear a coffee filter (seen that) instead.My original projection was that in June/July the whole situation would have been under control, no more lockdowns etc.,  however, no real progress was made.​Tensions, consequences?

If the plan was 100% equity gain plus premium from selling a call at the top, then there's your exit. Otherwise, best to go back to the trade journal and see what prior you was thinking."

So if you hold a stock and it runs you can just easily sell at a spike and you get profit.But trying to figure out if selling options on it would maximize the profits more. Then the other scenario is if I don’t mind holding it long term but want to take an advantage of a spike/hype would that change the first answer. I wish I could see what options looked like at the day of the QS spike to see the premium that would have been on those.

Vega would probably eat some profits, but not be too bad.Btw... you do need to be a bit careful if intentionally shorting vol.  A lot of people think to simply short high vol tickers... they fail to realize they're usually high vol because MMs expect a lot of movement.  And sometimes MMs do have it mispricex and it'll blow through a couple sigmas quickly.  I wouldn't ever sell vol on meme stocks for example, its just too unpredictable lol. When I short it, it's in the context of IV being a lot higher than historical vol and there is not a binary event (like earnings) which would account to for that elevated pricing. Basically, historical vol is like fair value and IV is what you're paying.  And its not like equities where value can be divorced from fundamentals for some time... it'll pay (or not) by expiration if fundamentals are off.  Also, the best plays for going short vol are long short straddles, short calendars (long the front month and sell the back), and long butterflies or iron condors."

If you're short vol, you would generally want to be delta/gamma neutral. If you're not delta neutral, you're kind of dealing with second level derivatives and have to monitor DdeltaDvol, otherwise known as vanna. Reduce the amount of influence the Greeks can have on your position and you have less factors to worry about.A true vol play would only care about two things, vega and theta. Theta eats into your profits if you're trying to long vol but didn't time it well, theta is your friend if you're short vol. Vega increasing is bad if you're short vol, good if you're long.u/rs6866 outlined some good strategies you can use, but I would consider those plays long vol since they benefit from a rise in volatility. Just do the exact reverse of what he said to be short vol.  This would be ala short strangle and straddle, long calendars, short iron condors and butterflies, and if you want directional bias, short call and put spreads (but ratioed for your delta bias), and jade lizard.Just try to keep your strategies simple and easy to understand. Once they get complicated, it's hard to figure out how the math can turn against you and how to exit with your shirt on. Also, I try to not do plays that require positions in different expirations, the probability calculators tend to not be able to price those positions very well (other than calendars, you should be able to do that math on your own).I woke up in the middle of the night to type this, so I apologize if I don't make too much sense.

I mean it’s almost a certainty we’re going to get it, but is it “priced in”..In my mind I have the thought that long gold/short bonds is gonna be the trade, but am I/what am I missing?"

Mostly long dated treasuries but I'm gonna guess that they don't have as much of an effect on cost debt compared to the short end assuming most corporate debt is shorter termed. I know that the fed primarily manipulates the short end of the curve and the primary mechanism of monetary policy transmission is from the overnight cash market through to the rates at which banks can offer on its loans. It seems like this rise in yields in response to reflation and possibly lower solvency risk in risk assets but it seems unclear to me as to what effect these treasuries have on the cost of debt in the economy . i.e. is this less important than the fed raising the fed funds rate.The relationship between bonds and equities seems very strange at times, on one hand low yields indicate cheap debt which props companies up yet on the other hand higher yields indicate movement back into risk assets.

In the summer, yes it may be 100 deg outside, but at 70deg inside delta T is 30 degrees.  Insulation and delta T determine how much heat is transfered, A/C makes up this difference.Now, much of texas has temperatures in the 20's or lower.  Delta T is now 50+ degrees (40+ if inside temp is reduced to 60F).  With the same insulation, almost 2x the heat has to be moved to maintain temperatures.  I'd wager that most of texas uses heat pumps (run your a/c in reverse to move heat from outside to inside).  Unfortunately... most heat pumps don't really work well when the temperature falls under freezing, and especially if snow gets on the consensor coils (which really run as evaporators when in heat pump mode) outside.  If the heat pump fails, the difference is made up with resistive heating, which is 3-4x less efficient.  So, people with heat pumps need roughly 6-8x the electricity to heat their house in these temperatures than to cool their house in 100 deg heat.Assume some gas makes up the difference... maybe the power demand is still 3-5x.  That's still going to be way above grid capacity."

I.e. I'll take a 1.5~3% loss on the account, knowing that my target will be about 5~10% gain on the account.  This is the approach I had to take when I started trading futures...  The fact that you could immediately end up down $50 on a pair of /MES going against you by 5 handles was hard to handle because that was an immediate 1% off the account (started small) but then looking at exits, percent risked vs percent reward, made it a lot easier...and I think makes it a lot easier to scale.  Especially if you have a strategy that works well.  Might not be too difficult to back calculate the percentage gain your average position adds vs your average loss just to get an idea, then try to maintain that going forward as you scale"

I've said it for years... but as great of an idea as it is to harness these types of power sources (and they do have their place!), we will not eliminate carbon until we move to a nuclear-powered economy.  Nukes or carbon, you have to pick one.  When politicans say they're for eliminating CO2 emission, but won't consider nuke power, I honestly can't take them seriously.As a side note... if the government did with fusion power what they did with the moon race in the 60's, we'd absolutely accomplish it in 1-2 decades.  The materials are close, the science is close, but we need to get good, hard data from larger scale reactors.  It would also spur a materials revolution in the same way the space race did.  It's within reach to have a large capacity/excess of 0 emission (other than helium) power which we could sell to other countries to offset the taxpayer funded R&D.  Cheap power across the country would also be a huge benefit to Americans who'd see their power bill drop, and would allow manufacturing to flourish here, bringing jobs.

Selling the front and buying the back is what's profitable.  But it wasn't always profitable... sometimes it went down.So to test my thesis and see if this has to do with the borrowing cost, I'm going to normalize this difference by the cost of BTC.  If BTC's price goes up, the spread should widen as the carrying cost will also go up.  Testing this... I get this plot, which is much more stable over time.  Not perfect, but much better."

It's appears super low risk (assuming you close at or near expiration), so imagine it as a lowish yield but high probability profit to your target.Alright... let's do the math here.  As far as borrowing, I was referring to the OP's trade... buy physical bitcoin and short the futures.  Collect the spread.  The /btc futures contract is for 5 coins.  So you'd need to borrow $200k, buy 5 coins with it, and short the futures price.  If you assume 5% APY interest on the loan (this isn't exactly a mortgage with a physical asset the bank can take over), for 1/4 year that'd be 1.2% interest.  1.2% of 200k is ~$2024, or almost entirely the difference between futures and physical.  So that indeed accounts for most of the differential.  If you tried to do a calendar on futures contracts alone, that differential should hold over the life of the contract.Ohh this would be spicy indeed, but is there any historical context for a spike to be nearly this high?There's not.  But... institutions and hedge funds are in the mix now with billions at stake.  If this run-up does indeed proove to be a bubble and a selloff gets sparked, liquidity is bought in BTC by increasing transaction fees.  Blocks occur every 10 min... so if you miss a block as price is in freefall, you're left holding the buck longer.  How much do you think HF's and institutions will be willing to put as a tx  fee to get out?  I could easily see it going to 1k, 10k, or even 100k if it means the difference in billions in profit for them.  The guy who'll get stuck holding the buck is the retail investor with a physical wallet who can't afford to compete with HF's when there's a premium put on liquidity."

And by looking at this, I would get emotional and want to short this market because surely it can’t go up forever, right? I mean, we had green days in a row and then 3 flat days of consolidation. At some point we have to pullback.This pullback doesn’t HAVE to come, but if it does, it is still at least 150pts away. I will lay out my bullish thesis below, and the reason I remain long and shall continue rolling calls:---------------------Instead of looking at SPY to predict what direction the market will move, we must look at the components of the market. Let’s start with healthcare.IHE is breaking out of SEVEN YEAR BASE. The rally in pharmaceuticals is merely beginning, and I am a big breakout buyer. This thing will, at a minimum, double over the next few years.Let’s look at another more popular ETF- the XLV. If we believe that the big October run was the pole of a bull flag and then the flag was formed from 11/9 to 11/30, then we must replicate the bull flag breakout in both time and price. The breakout target for XLV is $122.19, which WE HAVE YET TO REACH. Although we can see again that from 1/27 to 2/11 we were yet again consolidating for a breakout https://imgur.com/a/tYPRYF6. Again, this is HIGHLY BULLISH and I am a breakout buyer.If healthcare moves higher, the market cannot crash.----------------- Next, I would like to look at transports. For this, I have selected the IYT, the Dow Jones Transport ETF. The IYT is BREAKING OUT OF A FIVE YEAR BASE! I am again a buyer of this technical breakout.This is a majorly rock hard bullish sign, as transports are often viewed as a leading signal for the economy. Which by the way, is indicative of the move in bonds we are currently seeing. Morgan Stanley agrees that yield strength is driven on the back of an improving economic backdrop.If you are a believer in Dow Theory, this is another bullish sign.----------------- Next I would like to discuss energy stocks./CL is one of the most bullish technical setups I can currently find. It is constantly bull flagging into a breakout. Then another bull flag into a breakout. If we are to believe Friday’s move was a true technical breakout, then we must respect the equal legs principal and complete an equal move in both time and price. We should see /CL trading at $63.77 by 2/23, which is next Tuesday.https://imgur.com/a/nvVKDGYA break of $63 on a weekly chart would also confirm the commodity supercyle that many strategists have been predicting. IMO we are FAR from the peak of crude oil demand given the wide array of petro uses in our daily lives, and this goes far beyond transportationXLE should breakout above its June high and should target $51, which is the bull flag target of the December low.I am also long KMI strictly because it a related energy name with the lowest implied vol in the sector. This is my largest position via calls. KMI should also target $16 in the next 2-3 weeks. Then $20s this summer.Gas prices are rising. Energy stocks are expected to have EPS increases of up to 600% this year. The market cannot crash when these backbone stocks rally.----------------- I would like to discuss real estate stocks.The IYR is the widely used REIT ETF, which has already broken above its June high. If we are to believe that the consolidation from June to October was a giant bull flag, then the next equal legs bull flag target is $93.But… we already have confirmation that the REIT ETF is going higher since we also look at its components. SPG is one of the top holdings and it is breaking out even after bad FFO earnings. It is now on track to fill the March gap.Look at housing prices! They are through the roof. The market cannot crash if real estate is performing well.(I am not long any REITS, but AGNC and O have historically low IV and should follow their peers if you want to be long).----------------- Now we should discuss tech stocks since this is the only sector that actually matters.First of all, we saw some of the largest dark pool buying in tech stocks that we have seen in 11 weeks https://imgur.com/a/houLekaBut specifically I would like to touch on AMZN, which has also seen HUGE dark pool buying the past 15 trading sessions. AMZN has been a pain as it has yet to break out of this wedge, but it will pop soon. Whether that is this week or next month I am unable to predict. But it will happen.See, we already have confirmation that AMZN will break out and lead the market to new highs. MSFT already broke out above its September highs and reached new ATHs, AAPL also went to new ATHs above its September high, and NVDA is acting as a leading indicator by also breaking out of its 6 month consolidation to brand new ATHs. QQQ also formed a bull flag from the March low which then consolidated from September to November. We then place the original flag pole at the breakout spot to determine the equal legs target which puts QQQ at $419 by the end of this year. And this is conservative.NFLX is another piece of confirmation that tech will go to new ATHs. On earnings it broke out to $590 and has since backtested the breakout. THIS IS NOT BEARISH. It held and has since consolidated and is ready for the next leg higher. By applying the bull flag principal again, we are targeting mid- $800s by end of summer. Again, this is CONSERVATIVE. There was huge call buying in the June and July strikes last week. (I am long calls.)It is silly to think that AMZN will lag while all other tech stocks rally. The market cannot crash when tech performs. In fact, when tech leads, the SPX is invincible.----------------- Other factors and my beliefs:Global Equity flows have reversed just 20% of the record outflows since 2018. This means there is a record amount of money still on the sidelines. Nice even numbers like 4000 really induce some FOMO, don’t they? IF history repeats itself, buyers may just be getting started.JPM published a piece this weekend (unable to share due to copyright) that says they believe based on herd immunity and vaccine rates, COVID will be over in 40-70 days.The return to VIX < 15 seems possible, and actually likely. Implied Vol is far above Realized vol as folks keep piling into upside calls. A close above 4000 will cause massive hedges to be unwound.93% of all stocks are currently above their 200d sma. The last time this occurred was October 2009. Since then very, very good things have happened in the market. Doesn’t mean it will occur again, but this is a broad based rally and not subject to just one sector.Far too many people do not believe in this rally and keep shorting it. The rally will end when they stop shorting it. Until then, they are the only guaranteed buyers and will keep adding momentum.SPX 4500-4600 this summer and 5000 year-end is the most likely scenario as tech, semis, and banks rally in tandem to new ATHs."

Thanks for all you (and all the other mods) do for this place.As for suggestions, I agree that the sidebar could use a revamp/update. To me, a lot of what makes this sub so special and valuable is not when people share their successes (I made $x.xx), but when they share HOW they made that money and probably more importantly, how they didn't lose money. So to that affect, I think it would be really cool for the best minds of this sub to collaborate on a learning series of some sort where a few people that specialize in a certain style/methodology/tool create posts that highlight their strategy (without directly leaking alpha), talk about benefits/drawbacks, and answer questions. Maybe after a few are published, we could vote on the best ones to be posted to the sidebar or wiki?

Be a sponge, soak it up.Second, the MRP post I myself have said was the good standard for that type of trading. I have a massive post draft saved that expands on it because although that post is GOLD for the execution portion of it, it doesn’t go into the most important part, execution. Third, the sharing of information is directly proportional to the amount of people seeing the information. As there are more eyes, the willingness to share goes down, such is the nature with things and there’s education, and edge. It’s one thing to try and help educate, truly another to share true alpha.Semi buzzed edit- the mrp post is why I trade how I do, I’ll give absolute credit where it’s due. The principles are valid."

At the same time, I wouldn't want those who are more experienced to be inconvenienced by the training wheels that come with some of these discussions. (For example, the /r/options subreddit has some really smart people, yet the conversations often get bogged down with the same dozen questions)Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like the daily market discussions are more casual, free flowing narrative of what's going on in the market that day- and I love it. Oftentimes it just doesn't lend itself to more specific questions, or the questions get overlooked, which makes sense cause, well, everyone is trading.Some Q&A sessions on certain topics would be cool (day-trading, technical analysis, futures). For instance, I'd like to be able to ask other day-traders what % of their portfolio they use per trade, and what % they like to set their stops and losses. Or ask a TA wizard what chart durations they like to use for finding ascending/descending triangles. While the sidebar has an incredible amount of factual information, sometimes I just like to see what other people are doing- not necessarily to mimic it, but just for perspective and reflection on my own practices.Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has been patient with my silly questions and sarcastic quips in the daily discussions- it's made my last few weeks of trading more enjoyable, and while I have no quantitative data to backup the following, I believe it to be true; A profitable trader is a happy trader, but a happy trader need not be profitable - Me, just now.Disclaimer: I'm new here so take my advice with a grain of salt."

Perhaps I'm unaware of when the ban hammer comes out but for the most part it seems like when people come in here pretending this is WSB 2.0 they get chased off pretty quick as a lot of the frequenters end up jumping them.As people become more frequent posters the allowable gray area for discourse could/should become a bit wider.  Some people have a way educating others that does come off as a bit derogatory... I've seen it, I've been the recipient of it, but most importantly learned from it and appreciate it.  Lots of others have taken their lickings the same way but occasionally peoples' egos get in the way.  Personally I don't know how to moderate something like this and I really don't envy your job as moderator...but I do appreciate you guys for stepping up to the plate.As for politics I don't mind it - it's pretty easy to scroll past but its also easy to understand that a lot of people are probably still feeling hungover from how opinionated everyone was around the election time.  Unfortunately the next one is in 3.5 more years so what we learned now we'll need to remember then, but the separate swamp thread is probably the only thing that stood between me and wearing the rubber off my mouse wheel.Maybe we need a quick 3~4 bullet point/sentence readme before new users are able to post?

Filling disclosed on Feb. 10th, and the day after the 'real breakout' started. Probably coincidence but I like to write down everything as I investigate further.Shares float is 614.98m, they have 11.6m so not really significant.Q3 fillingQ4 fillingAnother big holder, Exchange Traded Concepts, has more than doubled its stake from one quarter to the next (1,609,497 to 3,520,116 shares).Q4 fillingSo let's say it's actually a pump and dump. From looking at the option flow, this afternoon from the puts sale they got about $1.8m in premium. The calls buying from yesterday cost about $2.5m minimum (that the number I can attribute to the same entity for sure). So total cost is about $700k as a very very low estimate.A more realistic estimate for the cost of the call buying is about $10m, so let's say $8m with the premium they got today. Then I would have to account for the shares buying.So the price they paid so far is almost certainly greater than their current holdings. At that point, either I'm missing something or someone is taking a position in good faith. I really want to rule out the pump and dump hypothesis because it doesn't make sense to risk more than you have.Ok one last thing: Dr. Burry pinned a tweet on Feb. 12th:If the government is going to spend $2 trillion, there is no better use than converting the US to nuclear.Last time I checked Scion doesn't have any exposure to this sector.

A solitary long M2KH21 contract. Spent the last two weeks reading and going through the last year's charts and strategies. I'm planning to do low-leverage, strictly TA-based, multi day swing-trades following the 1hr IC cloud.  I really like chart-trading and find it hard to do anything of that matter in today's News Cycle/P&D/Covid small-cap market and don't have enough capital to trade the slower-moving mega caps or indexes.So here's the plan - Entry strategy: When it breaks above the Senkou, and stays above to finish the 1hr candle, go long. When it breaks below (unless we're in a real bear market) I won't be going short for now. Too many fake corrections lately and I'm adequately hedged elsewhere.Exit strategy: Mostly looking for a break back through the bottom of the cloud. I tend to chronically take profit too early, so looking at closing the trade when it enters the cloud will likely lead to missed profits (it seems about 80% of the time it has skipped back above, lately). I can also take profit on big divergences from the Tenkan and Kijun, but those are more intuition based.Risk management: Usually plan to set the Risk-off at the top of the Senkou which we just broke through. Though I won't risk more than 5% of my portfolio (well, this account, not whole portfolio) at any moment. Today's trade, with 16:1 leverage, gave me just over 4% portfolio risk with 8.3pts to breathe.The goal is to make this the most boring, patient strategy possible where I'm waiting for the perfect setup and playing with low enough risk to sleep at night while a trade is live.Let me know if you have critiques and, of course, I'll keep you updated on the progress!"

My thought is trying to find something that, as vol gets cheap and downside momentum gets slow (despite the fact that it gets cheaper every day) being able to pick something up and wait for movement.  VIX calls seem to be silly because going over a month out is expensive, and theta decay can eat you alive.  Also I don't really have a good 'handle' on VIX options pricing relative to the VIX, but the long options I had seemed really lackluster.  They were timed perfectly and while I made some profit on them it was not nearly what I was expecting.  Perhaps one risk defined method of longing volatility is to sell VIX puts once the downward momentum slows.  But still seems extremely difficult to make any money in themThe areas I was looking at was UVXY.  It seems like you can pick up UVXY calls with some time for reasonably cheap.  UVXY Seems to be short term futures so I assume cost of carry ends up eating into these pretty bad?Asking because while shorting volatility is often the safer play (from the amount of time it spends going down vs up), outside of futures it seems difficult and shorting vol futures opens yourself up to tons of risk.  Secondly buying puts on VIX is kind of a fools errand as it's impossible to get a decent fill because it's mean reverting and everyone knows it's going to go back down.  So, how do you get a cheap option that tracks volatility well and ends up being risk defined without bleeding to death in the meantime?"

When a bond gets purchased, its a lot like how banks hypothecrate money to print more.  In many markets, bonds are as good as cash.  If it gets bought overseas, it stays overseas and doesn't raise the money supply.  If it gets bought here (by any party that isn't the fed), that money gets doubled... the buying party gets a bond which is as good as cash that they can spend, and the govt gets cash to spend.  Bam!  Money multiplied.Less foreign buyers means more hypothecration and more money being made in the money supply.  And more inflation.  This is also happening at a time when the govt is trying to borrow more.  More supply, less demand, and less foreign demand.  Thats why inflation is being considered a risk.  It is different this time... still may or may not materialize as I dont think anyone fully understands inflation... but it is different than other times in the last 20 years."

A stimuli can be something as simple as a weekly POC touch which to most traders under most conditions that says buy.Now consider that trading is an ever-evolving game.  In the 1960's the MACD was probably the bees knees but now using that is like driving a car using the rearview mirror.  Concepts like PoC, VAL, VAH, etc... were not traded on until...80's or 90's?  I wonder what life would have been like in the pits during the 60's or 70's only using weekly deviations.IMO a 'true' complete backtest cannot be ran on something that hasn't happened without understanding market participant behavior and how they will react to specific stimuli.  However if you are able to understand market participant behavior and come up with a reasonably accurate model for that; not only will you have the keys to the trading kingdom but you will be able to make the most accurate backtest possible for conditions that have not yet happened.  The downside is that this backtest is only for the current regime and will only work until market participant behavior begins to change based on new rules.  I.e. the internet and speed we gather data at will likely have made a market strategy from the 1940's irrelevant.  If WWIII broke out we'd know in 15 seconds while during WWII we couldn't even communicate that the Japanese were coming.Now moving away from that backtest it might be a little easier to model several behaviors of market participants and choosing the one that most accurately describes their response to whatever stimuli seems to driving things.A little further away again we can monitor data from multiple inputs (i.e. asset classes) to gauge what the market participants are doing or thinking.  A Common one we use is SPX up VIX up somethin's up.  But how about SPX down, VIX spike?  Seems lots of them went 'oh shit!' but with the 2 classes that's all we know... Now begin taking in dollar safe havens - /GC or DXY and look at the conditions again.SPX down, VIX spike, /GC up, DXY down.  Money isn't moving to cash, gold is operating normally hedging the downward movement in DXY, fear gauge spike, spx down - nothing too unusual -> determine optimal strategy -> buy dipAgain but change the inputs;SPX down, VIX spike, /GC up, DXY up.  Money is now moving to cash and gold?  Strange -> determine optimal strategy -> wait for behavior to normalizeAnyways, there might be another degree or two of analysis in here but we eventually end up at your idea - find closest conditions, extrapolate, create several models, choose the one that is fitting the best.What are your thoughts broham?"

A new large study of patients being admitted to hospital shows a reduction of 80% of the patients ending up in ICU and 65% reduction in death with those given the high dose of VitD upon admission (that you can only really get in hospital).Otherwise one would have to take the pills for a few months to get up to these protective levels.  Also note that previous studies show just not catching Covid at all is about 30% less with high VitD levels and ending up in hospital at about 50% lower.  So, 30%'s, 50%'s, 65%'s all add up together to a very protective effect.  I think technically these add together on top of each other so that risk of dying is about 78% less (as good as some of the vaccines really).  Take 4,000 iu everyday after breakfast or lunch.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3771318"

I think as a result of that scenario, you'd see subsequent administrations spending more and more time on increasingly elaborate and largely symbolic rituals where they distance themselves from the previous one. So rather than any distinct drop-off, there would be a gradual degradation in function. In that context, the move this summer where congressional dems embraced defund the police Et al. which cost them congressional seats, but actually made Pelosi's position as speaker stronger within the party reminds me of the Third Century Crisis. Where the frontiers of the empire were stripped of legions so a long list of claimants could fight internal wars laying claim to the imperial title.

Many of his songs are written from a perspective often unseen in lyrical narratives -- losers, fuckups, and weirdos, while injecting it with some humor so as to not make it completely pathetic and sad.For this sub specifically, this song is from the perspective of a guy who recently  lost his job in HK trading against the pound.Another classic with tangential relation to money/finance/deals at one point.Give me your weird alternative music!!Edit: I like pretty much all genres if I find it interesting/unique!

Depends on if you have enough net worth to comfortably enjoy life with kids and to still compound and keep growing. If not and you’re you’re young, I would try to get there first. Raising a kid when you don’t have your money situation figured out is a difficult mid life waiting to happen.  But if you’re pretty comfortable and 30s then you have to assess where enough is in terms of net worth.

Prior to 6 months she took 4 micronaps (25 minutes or less) a day. She would cry for 5-10 minutes before going down and we would get a whole 25 minutes (or less) of peace. At night we didn't go to full 8 hours until she was 10 mo. We let her cry it out before that up to 30 minutes. I do not miss those days. I was a freaking zombie and of course it was right when I landed a really complex and extremely high risk project. Ugh...ptsd is kicking in...need....a....beer...
