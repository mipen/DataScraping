Question for you. Do you hold your penny stocks long term or short or both. I only ask because I am newer to this and have loved every second of it. I put together the last few days 10 penny stocks I am buying with 150.00 in each. I started last week but really was getting into the bulk of purchases this week. At what point do you guys sell vs. hold. I know a lot is personal but is there some ""rules"" the group follows when it comes to this stuff. Trying to absorb all I can right now.   
Thanks for all your patience and help.

Look up 12 unpopular stocks, most likely in the pennies range with a small market cap.  The number 12 is really important here, you are doomed to fail if you pick more or less.  Number these stocks, 1 through 12. The number 1 will be your least favorite. Take 2, 6 sided dice. Roll both dice. Whatever you're number is, DO NOT BUY THAT STOCK. Refer back to you're ""number 1,"" aka your least favorite stock. Invest in that stock. Thank me later",,

So if you put in another $100 you'll get 200 shares, and have 300 shares for $200, or $.66 share cost, all you had to do was double your investment and you lowered your average by 34%. Thus lowering the Gain Required to Make up for a Loss very quickly. 
Dollar cost averaging and understanding how to use it will save your ass from just selling or bag holding for longer than necessary. There are times when a stock will drop and the best decision is actually to load up 2x-3x your investment and then sell immediately when it recovers to no loss or a small profit versus waiting for a full recovery to you original purchase. Or you could end up just triple bag holding, but at least now you're committed lol and if the train does leave the station then you're set.",,

Basically, this chart was designed to shock the person reading it. I learned about this is my advanced statistics class in college when we studied charts and graphs and the knowing what they actually convey vs. what they intend to convey. At first glance this looks shocking to someone investing in the stock market and downright scary. In reality, this isn't how stocks or products and services work. That is because of something called Intrinsic Value (measure of what an asset is worth. This measure is arrived at by means of an objective calculation or complex financial model, rather than using the currently trading market price of that asset). As you can see i just copy pasted this definition but the bold parts are what matter the most. Loss and gain of an asset's value is natural in an economy, but it's intrinsic value remains constant and usually corrects itself within a limited window of time. So while this chart isn't wrong, be careful when understanding what it's really saying.",,

Since this is exponential, a 99% loss would need like 100,000% gain and so on. Given that 100% loss means you technically need infinite% growth to match (which is impossible starting at 0, which is 100% loss).",,

Here is the reference of the gain required to break even,Reddit_pennystocks_2021-02-17.csv,REDDIT,,reddit,"Here is how I do it even if I am long on a company. Much of what you said I have similar feelings on. What I do is when something jumps more than 30%, I set a sell trigger at a Price I am happy with. If it keeps going up, I just simply move the trigger with each major move. 
If it sells and I am long on the company, I take my profits and diversify in other investments or keep that money to chase the next opportunity. The original capital investment will buy back in at the higher market price and ride the long ride. If it continually jumps, I will keep skimming profits as a bove. 
​
Why do I do this? Do I realize I am missing potential? I sure do... but I also know making it through the ups and downs with a $TSLA or $AMZN is like trying to win the lottery. Making money in the market is a marathon, not a sprint and a series of small wins will play out over time.",,

I always assumed that you can invest so that you can determine a appropriate amount depending on the risk and gains of your investment. 
Besides that I always tend to review things on a week by week basis. If a stock fluctuates frequently between two certain values it doesn't really make sense to look at those in percentages instead of real values because the percentages are not really in proportion to eachother unless you take them from an average (of previous week for example). Let's say a stock fluctuates between 0.60 and 0.80 which according to the chart is a -25% or a +33% depending on which way you are going. The percentages kind of suggest that it would be harder to gain than to lose but that might just not be the case.

A stock that drops 50% bc of something has still more value in it than the current share price thus it will recover more quickly.. 

This is definitely not true. A stock could go from $100 to $50 and then continue to fall to $40, $30, $20. 

that is why we are 'buying the dip'.. nobody would do that if the stock would have to double from scratch..

People are buying the dip because they believe the price of a stock will increase. This has nothing to do with the math necessary for a recovery.",,

You could start with another $100 and make a 40% gain, but you can't just do that with larger amounts.  If your portfolio is $80k and you bet it all on a penny stock and you lose 50% down to $40k, you can't just drop in another $100k and make 40% gain to recover it.  Your portfolio is worth $40k now and that's it.  You have to go find a way to make a 100% gain to get back to normal, which is very unlikely.
You have the chart backwards - it doesn't show our emotional response. It shows the factual reality of how hard it is to recover from a loss, that is not intuitively obvious to most.  Our emotional reactions prevent us from seeing clearly what this graph is saying.
You mention weighing risk - that's very true, and understanding this charts implications of the struggle recovering from a loss is critical to weighing risk appropriately.",,

In all seriousness, you need to watch the DD, determine a good entry and decide the type of strategy that you personally are comfortable with, and then stick to it. Penny stocks are not generally safe and you have to know the level of risk you're willing to take, and the type of reward you'll be happy with if the risk pays off. This is all subjective, and other people's PTs may never come true or simply not apply to your unique situation in the first place. If you think it will rise, then you can make the informed investment to buy in and then form an exit strategy from there.",,

Evaluating the industries most interesting pure play, and the significance of approaching catalysts.",Reddit_pennystocks_2021-02-17.csv,REDDIT,,reddit,"Regulatory approval for psychedelic research was reinstated in 2000, and has been occurring ever since. In 2000, the FDA approved the first psychedelic based treatment for a psychiatric disorder, called Spravato. 
A similar argument was made against cannabis, but decriminalization and legalization are occurring regularly. 
In recreational use, drugs like LSD and Psilocybin demonstrate a better safety profile, and a lack of dependance. Regulatory hurdles and social stigma are what prohibited modern research, and that has changed significantly. 

In conclusion, and despite some controversial results mentioned above, LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing double-blind clinical trials with this substance, new studies performed under modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge, help erase the stigma that still prevails around these substances and open new doors in the future.

Psychedelic drugs don't require recreational decriminalization or legalization for treatments to develop, or for these companies to commercialize products. In fact, the CEO of MindMed has spoken out against decriminalizing. 

“This isn’t the 1960s all over again. I want nothing to do with those kinds of folks who want to decriminalize psychedelics,” Rahn told Forbes. “You don’t have to be a revolutionary. You just need to show up to work every day, do the rigorous science, take a pragmatic approach and we’ll get there.”

While not sufficient for FDA approval, anecdotal evidence is overwhelming. Johns Hopkins has produced multiple promising studies since they began researching these substances in 2000, as have several other facilities globally. Previous political and propaganda based restrictions are what limited research, and with those easing, it’s a source of promise, not doubt.

Phase 4 can still take several years until there is enough trust and data. The big money will be spent when phase 4 is already a few years happening.
Also don´t forget: This is highly specialized treatment, not just taking pills. Until this lifts off and enough people are trained to perform this safely another few years are down the road. We have good psychotherapeutical methods from the late 90s, which took around 20 years to become standards. Never seen a method becoming a standard in under 10 years.
Also: MDMA is a very cheap drug, a dose can be easily produced for under 1$. You don´t need many doses for treatment. This would be still a multimillion dollar business but surely not billions. Keep that in mind when you do your DD.

HITIF is a grouping of companies. Some of their stores are retail stores that sell THC containing products (flower, edibles, consumables in some fashion), as well as products to allow users to consume those goods (smoking vessels). They also deal with this in retail as is. They also have a CBD specific business venture as well. 
Will weed be sold in CBD shops? That would depend on the legalization and regulation of how Cannabis selling stores can be setup. THC and CBD are different feelings when ingested, but there is still overlap in the market for users. People who use THC still will use CBD and vice versa. When I was in Oregon which is a legal state, Cannabis selling shops still sold pure CBD products. 
I personally do not think that CBD products would go down, if anything there may be an increase in them based on the fact there will be more stores, and possibly more of a focus in creating and legitimatizing cannabis as an industry. Anecdotal evidence I have heard from said Cannabis shop is that non-hemp derived CBD is better and a bit more potent in cases. I believe the majority of CBD is currently hemp derived in the states, so that would change and be improved. 

This is not financial advice, and I am by NO means a cannabis expert, just some points to consider.",,

CBD has shown promising results but still has a long way to go as far as people actually recognizing its positive effects.  Legalization of THC will have little to no impact on the CBD side because the THC consumers are in it to get high.  THC will have rapid growth and CBD will be a much longer hold.  Many weed smokers (people who ""do"" weed) feel this is quite an exciting time to be alive and will be happy to buy at the higher price for convenience and the tax revenue it will generate will be extraordinary when legalized on a federal level.  
That being said.  It may appear as if THC has a negative impact on the sales of CBD but really it will just be leaving it in the dust.

The proce of these stocks can't technically decrease, but what can happen is a ""reverse split.""  This is a move by the company to consolidate stocks in order to increase the price of their stock.  It makes the stock look more respectable, and can help companies with outstanding shares to reduce that number, and potentially uplist to better markets.
A reverse split can be any ratio, but for example, in a reverse split of 10: 1, all shareholders with 10 shares will now have 1 share, worth 10 times as much.  So ten shares of a .0001 stock value will now be 1 share of .001 stock value.  Seems like no big deal, you still have the same value of a stock, right?  Except that now that you have stock of value above .0001, it can, in fact, decrease further to .0001 again, costing you 9/10 of your value.  What's more, reverse splits for stocks that are at this value are generally considered considered bad for this reason.  So market psychology can take over, and after a reverse spit of subpenny stocks, many people may sell off their shares to mitigate losses, which will nearly certainly result in a price drop within a short period.  
So in theory, a .0001 stock is not really safe from losing value.  
Also I'm super new to stocks in general, so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.",,

Apparently got pumped last week. Their 1 and only event last year was at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.

It is also true that we are not current in our filings with the SEC. We have made it a priority to reduce the number of convertible lenders involved with LFC. Not long ago we had 6 funders. We have bought out all but one, most recently buying out EMA Financial for $175,000 in November. The single remaining funder is a fan of LFC and has pledged to trade our shares responsibly (that was not always the case with the others). I am hopeful we will be current again within the next three months and have made that a priority.

...

Finally to the Reddit user who posted that I was a ‘crackhead’ thank you very much for your concern but I assure you I am not nor have I ever been a drug user (I don’t even drink coffee). When I dreamed up Lingerie Fighting Championships I was fully lucid (as hard as that is for some people to believe!)
