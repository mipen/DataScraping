From what I‚Äôve looked into the demand for uranium is only going up and in recent years uranium has supplied 90% of the requirements for power utilities. If you look at uranium prices pre Hiroshima there is a large gap that is being filled by clean energy demands. The projected growth for the price per pound of uranium is approx 26% for years 2020-2030. However, with the increase of electricity demands rising and worries about carbon emissions, the demand for uranium powered energy can only rise. Hence, DNN (uranium mine in Canada) appears to be a solid bet for growth this year especially with the expected price rebound for uranium in 2021.

alvador Vergara was so enthusiastic about GameStop Corp. in late January that he took out a $20,000 personal loan and used it to purchase shares. Then the buzzy stock plunged nearly 80%.

GameStop‚Äôs volatile ride is hitting the portfolios of individual investors like Mr. Vergara who purchased the stock in a social-media-fueled frenzy. These casual traders say GameStop was their ‚ÄúYOLO,‚Äù or ‚Äúyou only live once,‚Äù trade. They bought around its late January peak, betting it would continue its astronomical climb. While some cashed out before it crashed, others who hung onto their shares are in the red.
Mr. Vergara, a 25-year-old security guard in Virginia, started investing four years ago after deciding he wanted to retire young. To save money, he drives a 1998 Honda Civic, eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad. He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds, which are now valued at about $50,000. Then Mr. Vergara, a longtime reader of the WallStreetBets page on Reddit, saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stock‚Äôs colossal rise.

He didn‚Äôt want to touch his index-fund investments, so instead he got a personal loan with an 11.19% interest rate from a credit union and used it to fund most of his GameStop purchase. He bought shares at $234 each.

Rising Action: Price of GME goes up, u/DeepFuckingValue updates us and we start to get inspired by him, gamma squeeze happens
Climax: The news showcase the hype around wallstreetbets, everyone and their mothers invest their life savings into GME, GME goes up to $400, hedge funds get fukt
Falling Action: u/zjz removed from mod team, u/DeepFuckingValue on hiatus from SEC investigation, Robinhood and hedge funds now fukt us over and bring GME back down to $50, buncha ü¶çü¶ç still continue to bag hold GME at $300, people lose trust in each other in this subreddit

Today, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Committee on Financial Services, made the following statement regarding recent market instability.¬†
‚ÄúHedge funds have a long history of  predatory conduct and that conduct is entirely indefensible. Private  funds preying on the pension funds of hard working Americans must be  stopped. Private funds engaging in predatory short selling to the  detriment of other investors must be stopped. Private funds engaging in  vulture strategies that hurt workers must be stopped.¬†
‚ÄúAddressing that predatory and manipulative conduct is the  responsibility of lawmakers and securities regulators who are charged  with protecting investors and ensuring that our capital markets are  fair, orderly, and efficient. As a first step in reining in these  abusive practices, I will convene a hearing to examine the recent  activity around GameStop (GME) stock and other impacted stocks with a  focus on short selling, online trading platforms, gamification and their  systemic impact on our capital markets and retail investors.¬†
‚ÄúWe must deal with the hedge funds whose unethical conduct directly led  to the recent market volatility and we must examine the market in  general and how it has been manipulated by hedge funds and their  financial partners to benefit themselves while others pay the price.‚Äù¬†

It could not be more obvious. We are pigs to be bled for labor and cash, nothing more, nothing less, and if we dare try to move up we are talked to like children, made fools of in the media, and tied back down with regulations to ""protect us"" while actually just keeping us from playing on the same level field as the banks and hedgefunds.
Never forget that Janet Yellen, our Treasury Secretary, who is overseeing this GME investigation was paid $810,000 by Citedel for two 30min talks and a webinar, and our Press Secretary Psaki's brother is a portfolio manager at Citedel.

The Failure to Deliver data from the second half of January is out!  It's about what you'd expect:
1/15    892,653
1/19    1,498,576
1/20    1,007,562
1/21    1,438,994
1/22    273,600
1/25    275,113
1/26    2,099,572
1/27    1,972,862
1/28    1,032,986
1/29    138,179
‚Äã
Oh, wow!  That is a huge number of FTDs!!  But I guess they covered, because it jumps down so much at 1/29, right?  Well, in addition to potentially covering that number by shorting more, look at our friendly GME heavy ETF (XRT):
1/15    10,187
1/19    9,134
1/20    1,144
1/21    17,703
1/22    23,125
1/25    112,536
1/26    127,661
1/27    80,112
1/28    385,651
1/29    2,218,348
In two weeks XRT goes from having about 10,000 FTDs to OVER TWO MILLION.  That is fucking enormous.  This shit is huge, and they are willing to do anything to try and get away with it.  This is not financial advice--I'm just a monkey counting bananas promised versus bananas given.

It sounds like hedge funds shorted GME by borrowing shares and selling them hoping to buy them back cheaper later (or not at all, if it goes bankrupt).  Then, apes bought up the stock so that the hedge funds couldn't buy them back (and GME didn't go to 0).  Then, the stock borrowing hedge funds Fail To Deliver the stock back.  
Who owns the stocks?  Apes definitely own the stock.  Do those who lent stock to hedge funds still have the stock?  No, right?  Except the brokerages who lent out their customer stocks, it seems like those brokerages would still on the hook for returning stock to the customer, right?  Or will those brokerages tell the customers that ""sorry, we lent that out and it got lost in the mail""?
Is a FTD essentially a ""Sorry sucka!  Sucks to be you for letting me borrow!""?",,

They're stalling to protect the hedge funds when they should be doing their jobs and investigating Melvin and their kind. 
If any SEC employees are here, here's a hint, go look at data for XRT and compare it to that for GME. They are basically paying one credit card with another. 
If any ""normal"" person did what these hedge funds are doing now with stocks OR debt, they'd be a criminal. You can be sued for not repaying your debts. But apparently selling stuff you don't own and then not paying for it afterwards, then manipulating an entire market to try and cheat their way out of a legitimate loss is just fine if you're rich! Meanwhile the economy (veins) of the country is stagnating while the likes of these hedge funds (internal hemmorhage) has pooled money (blood) and is working to keep growing that pool. Meanwhile there's less and less blood in the veins and eventually they (economy, market) will succumb from the blood loss (crash).
Now pretend the blood would still be good, imagine taking the blood back out of the hemmorhage pocket (squeeze) and injecting it back into the veins (economy) after patching the holes (regulations for hedge funds, deregulation for normal investors), now the economy (veins) is full of money (blood) where it can be used properly to keep the economy moving (like blood in your veins). There's your economic stimulus, forget the $1400 checks, when there's suddenly billions of extra dollars waiting to be spent instead of rotting in some bank account waiting to be shuffled to make more dirty money to continue to hold onto. America is practically anemic right now, thanks to corruption like this in my opinion. 
Well if they want to hold the money the economy needs to survive, maybe the human investors want to hold the stocks the hedge funds need to pay for and return. They lost their bad (and illegal) bet, and now they are refusing to pay their dues, safe in the knowledge they'll probably get a slap on the wrist and a free bailout. My hope is the SEC does something about this, like maybe forcing Melvin to pay their debts and stop selling stuff they don't own. 
SEC, DO YOUR JOBS PLEASE! This could create a lot of good in the country and the world if this deception and corrupt pooling of the countries lifeblood could be stopped.",,

There is something called ""Ex-Clearing"" which allows Broker-Dealer to Broker-Dealer clearing - so e.g. if 2 broker-dealers were colluding, they could just say to DTCC: ""hey we're all cleared, no FTDs here"", or ""hey we're cleared except for a small number of FTDs""... This would obviously mask the actual FTDs reported by the DTCC.
So take away is this: don't trust FTDs, don't trust DTCC reporting. They can be easily manipulated due to the many loop holes.

Most of these big companies aren't stupid enough to outright break the rules. They are just able to find the loopholes to avoid SEC action.
One key point some people are missing is that the FTD numbers are cumulative. The number is the total count of shares that are failed on that date, not the number of additional shares. So when that number drops, shares are being delivered.
Another example is a point on the threshold securities list. 0.5% of all shares must be FTD for 5 consecutive business days. One day where it dips below 0.5% and the count restarts.
Furthermore, you're assuming that the same shares are FTD. The shares that are FTD on any given day aren't necessarily the ones that were previously FTD. Companies could keep rotating to find new shares to borrow to cover the old ones. That way they would never technically be in violation.",,

No one actually cares. I keep seeing theories that no one will be allowed to short anymore, but I am not aware of that actually being a rule (or if it is, I'm not aware that it is enforced). Worst case they just pay a small fine.
These numbers are not cumulative, and thus are not as bad as they look. Each day's numbers include both new FTD's from that day, and unresolved FTD's from previous days.
It is theoretically possible (I think - someone correct me) that yesterday's FTD's are being delivered/closed out by unsettled transactions occurring today. In other words, today's FTD's are used to close yesterday's shares that failed to deliver. They can roll this out indefinitely.
This is still old data. All it really tells us is that this stock went nuts a couple weeks ago. Didn't we already know that?

All that said, I have a large long position. I personally think that earnings and the upcoming company transformation make it worth holding - the possibility of short squeeze V2.0 is icing on the cake.",,

Shorting, volume and supply can cause catastrophic results especially if everyone decides fuck this I am taking my cash out the banking system. Look at this from wiki - sounds familiar:
Augustus' brother, Otto, devised the scheme to corner United Copper, believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's¬†shares¬†had been¬†borrowed, and¬†sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a¬†short squeeze, in which the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.[19]
To finance the scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with¬†Charles T. Barney, president of the city's third-largest trust, the¬†Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that in order to attempt the squeeze, Otto needed much more money than Barney had, and Barney declined to provide funding.[20]¬†Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers were able to find plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.[21]
The stock closed at $30 on Tuesday and fell to $10 by Wednesday (Oct. 16). Otto Heinze was ruined. The stock of United Copper was traded outside¬†the hall¬†of the¬†New York Stock Exchange, literally an outdoor market ""on the curb"" (this curb market would later become the¬†American Stock Exchange). After the crash,¬†The Wall Street Journal¬†reported, ""Never has there been such wild scenes on the Curb, so say the oldest veterans of the outside market"".[22]
Contagion spreadsEdit
The failure of the corner left Otto unable to meet his obligations and sent his brokerage house, Gross & Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as¬†collateral¬†against some of its lending and had been a¬†correspondent bank¬†for the Mercantile National Bank in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.
F. Augustus Heinze's association with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved too much for the board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time,[23]¬†by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed¬†en masse¬†to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the¬†New York Clearing House¬†(a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests.[24]¬†By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.[25]
A week later many regional stock exchanges throughout the nation were closing or limiting trading. For example, the¬†Pittsburgh¬†city's¬†stock exchange¬†closed for three months starting on October 23, 1907",,

Amen.

Stocks clearly only exist to behave in the way the the elite want them to

Convincing the public otherwise is one of the greatest cons in modern history. There's never been a free market. There's never been any logic or rationale. It is and always has been a tool for the rich and powerful to secure their wealth and power.
So much of the American ethos, right down to the ""American Dream,"" is derived from what amounts to a carefully manicured lie. This lie is so effective at limiting what the public can conceive of that it has actually tricked people into defending fucking billionaires, as if they're in any way beneficent, necessary, or deserving (they're not, they're not, and they're definitely not). It has always been ""bootstraps for thee, not for me.""
The more people realize how utterly manufactured their lot in life is and the extent to which their opportunities are limited by design, the better. I promise you the elite will try to manipulate this narrative in a way that turns the lower classes against each other, because that's what they always do. It is a strategy as old as western civilization. Their entire playbook boils down to: ""Don't blame the rich and powerful. Blame immigrants. Blame poor people. Blame Republicans/Democrats. Blame hostile foreign powers. Blame fuckin' millenials while you're at it. Blame the nebulous entity that is 'the economy.' Just don't blame us. We're too important."" 
The enemy of virtually all progress in our Democracy is the upper class and its insidious desire to rationalize and protect its own status. I pray to the universe that this $GME fiasco will reveal this to more people.
We are living in the second American Gilded Age, and its perpetrators are better at playing the game than they were a century ago. We need to let go of the naive supposition that all we have to do is work harder. 
inb4: ""commie,"" ""muh trickle down,"" ""you're just a loser,"" and other stuff the billionaires' bootlickers like to say",,

So if they knew a squeeze was happening they can protect themselves by this etf thing. They can also buy a shit ton of shares on the uptick, ride the price surge and make a ton that way. Then they can short again to pick up gains on the way back down.  
But why stick it to us? If they have means to protect themselves, just let it ride, allow some poors to make a few grand. I prob would have sold at 500 or around there and been very happy--i wonder how many of us would have really held looking 3, 4, 10 grand in the face. Then after it rides a bit it would come back down to the point that they want and then execute their shorts...it just seems all so unnecessary!

Starting with what capital? Many WSBers had 10, 20 baggers, but it wasn't life changing money.

Do you see the disconnect here?

'If you have a registered person trading securities away from the firm and making recommendations to the general public, it is potentially a big supervisory miss,' said Brad Bennett, a former Finra enforcement director to the Journal.
'After 40 years in the industry, there is no question in my mind that if you are a registered representative [of a brokerage firm], you should not be communicating with anybody on Reddit,' Bill Singer, a regulatory defense lawyer said. 'That's the safest thing to do.'

It doesn‚Äôt matter. 
Prior convictions, bankruptcies, personal investments all need to be disclosed when you‚Äôre employed as a financial advisor because all of these can impact your judgment and the recommendations you give to clients as a fiduciary. That‚Äôs the regulation, even if he wasn‚Äôt currently giving financial advise to clients.

A registered broker-dealer in Massachusetts, like Mr. Gill, is not to make securities recommendations unless they are in the ‚Äúbest interest‚Äù of clients 

We are neither his clients (= people paying for his services) nor did he make a recommendation on GME, nor would it not have been in our best interest to buy the security when he did, even if we were clients and he recommended it to us, both of which he DIDN'T.
That law fails to be applicable by any of its definitions, except for Mr. Gill being a broker dealer. He is a broker-dealer, well done.

Although Mr. Gill will argue that he did not make recommendations to clients, the level of communication between members of the Reddit Mob and Mr. Gill may be a sufficient basis to find him in violation of those regulations.

Literally on what basis? None. Not a single specific communication that could be interpreted as a ""recommendation"" is named. Maybe Mr. Hutcheon needs to lay off the crack pipe.

In any event, a registered broker-dealer is constrained by regulations from engaging in the kind of ‚Äùboiler room‚Äù-like marketing effort that Mr. Gill is described as having done.

Described as ‚Äùboiler room-like marketing effort"" by whom exactly? Nobody has ever described it as that and backed it up with anything factual. That's not an accurate description of what happened, in fact it's entirely fabricated.

Indeed, Mr. Gill‚Äôs ‚Äúmarketing activities‚Äù look very much like the front end of a traditional ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù operation, which is violative market manipulation. 

Again, on what basis? He didn't market shit. He shared his process and his thoughts on why he thinks the stock is undervalued. This is a hit piece.

Moreover, he totally failed to inform his employer, Mass Mutual, of his activities on social media AND to provide it with copies of all relevant communications that might be deemed sent to clients OR potential clients. 

Again, nobody on the internet was his client. No one here ever paid Mr. Gill a single dime. Is this a real lawyer?

That‚Äôs the regulation, even if he wasn‚Äôt currently giving financial advise to clients.

Ok, fair enough. So on what grounds to you assume he didn't disclose his personal investments? And what law specifically did he break by not doing so, that might send him to prison?

A deep dive into how you think a stock is going to do well- as a registered financial advisor- can absolutely be perceived as a recommendation even if you don‚Äôt use the words ‚Äúthis is my recommendation.‚Äù

Based on what precedent? This seems like an unlawful extension of what the word ""recommendation"" means. I agree you don't have to use the word ""recommend"" but merely presenting your findings to the public does not constitute a recommendation by any stretch.

If this looks complicated, it‚Äôs because it is, but it is the law applicable to registered financial advisors and how they can communicate with the public regarding investing and disclosing said activity.

I don't think it looks complicated at all tbh. The relevant part at the bottom titled ""(f) Public Appearances"" requires a ""recommendation"" by a person associated with FINRA to be applicable, which did not occur. DFV may be a FINRA associate but he never recommended anything, so it isn't applicable.

I couldn‚Äôt tell you which specific charges they will hit him with- and he may avoid criminal charges altogether, but still be open to civil lawsuits.

So you agree with my initial statement that he won't go to prison after all?",,

So expect the squeeze to finally happen around that time or a bit after.

XRT
The investment seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of an index derived from the retail segment of a U.S. total market composite index. In seeking to track the performance of the S&P Retail Select Industry Index (the ""index""), the fund employs a sampling strategy. It generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the index. The index represents the retail segment of the S&P Total Market Index (""S&P TMI"").

According to stocktwits (LOL), XRT has 25% of their holding in GME currently.  Further, it has 200% short interest.
Now, generally speaking, 200% short interest is exactly the kind of thing I look for as an antecedent to a short squeeze (the implication is that somehow the float for that ETF has doubled without any action by the board that controls the ETF).
All of this is unverified information from highly untrusted sources and I am a hypocrite for even posting this given the level of verification I demand from others.",,

Paper handed bitch

Came into comments to say that too. 
I understand taking gains at $100-400 per share for a 10 bagger if you're some average joe with loans/rent/gf's-kids to pay, but imagine being the guy who shorted the entire US housing/insurance/banking industries, having your own fund, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars, and being in GME for over a fucking year only to bail at $17. I was thinking about GETTING IN at $20ish.

In other words: If they already won, why are they still here?

Because unlike half the retards on here, hedge funds actually like money. They want to make as much as possible. Whatever you believe about GME and its future, right now it has shitty fundamentals and the makings of a company that's about to die.
That attracts shorts. GME will always have high short interest until one of the following happens:
It goes bankrupt
or
It transforms into something new and actually makes profit.
Even if all the original shorts closed out their positions, more would just jump in because they like money and see an opportunity. It's a never ending cycle that, without insane momentum like we saw in late January, you can't beat.
Plus they often have a shit ton of money behind them so they can comfortably wait longer than you lot with your $53 you got from grandma that your worried you're gonna lose.",,

You will be able to profit from the sideways price action, be able to get in at a good price and possibly buy a few shares a week from the credits of your short put.
You can sell puts, assign a percentage of the profits from selling puts to buy shares and then sell the next week's puts. That way you are constantly making money while increasing your position size. Also if you can opt out of your broker's share borrow program that is helpful as well, so they are not borrowing your share and selling it back to you.
If more people took up this strategy, WSB could easily break the stalemate in 3 to 5 years.
I also have a GTC limit sell at 4x the cost basis of my long shares for 1/2 my position. That way if the price action hits that level, I can have my initial investment back plus profit and still hold half of my original position.

Depends on your belief now with the direction of the company. The play is still to quash shorts(if you are into that thing LOOL) & they are still in a bad position & doing everything they can to survive.

Shares are garbage. It‚Äôs a bit of paper and a promise. Here‚Äôs my dumbest explanation because man I am having a fucking dumb day. 
They have 4 methods to derive value based on what I can think of and how much beer is left in my fridge:


P/E, PEG, P/B and dividend


These are your traditional heralds of value. It‚Äôs what Boomers care about, it‚Äôs what tranche sellers care about, it‚Äôs what ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù care about. Basically a bunch of math : what would the firm be worth is we sold everything today, what it‚Äôs earning per share, what it‚Äôs growth value is per share, and if it‚Äôs paying you a portion of profit.


Predictability


You look at agricultural trends/futures, you can watch a sine wave of value. The adage ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt time the market‚Äù isn‚Äôt really true : consumer spending rockets in Q4. Crop prices will rise if the winter was horrifying. Some of these are repeater trends that you can make money on but it‚Äôs borrrrrring and you have to know your shit : a bad frost in hay-making country could mean expensive pork! But it could also mean import changes on pork. It‚Äôs a busy space.


Volatility.


Volatility is valuable if you‚Äôre hunting meme stonks. TLRY being up and down like your wife‚Äôs panties means intraday traders & HFTs are either losing or winning multiple Lambos a week. Ideally you want to be on the winning side. SNDL was an absolute bloodbath for it. Ideally, you want to predict this. Good fucking luck.


Magic value.


Magic value is held by very few stonks. AMD and Intel have it. TSLA is almost all magic. Weed stonks have it. Apple has it. Magic value is the promise of future returns based off of that companies ability to dictate the market, or the market being completely novel. TSLA is full of magic because Musk is the kind of person to randomly tweet ‚ÄúI guess the entire nation of Belgium wants to move to TSLA-powered home energy infrastructure‚Äù and then make that happen. AMD and Intel have it both because ?? Manufacturing hurdles (I did great on AMD when they announced 7nm gates) and their synergy with coins-that-cannot-be-named-please-Dont-automod-me. Apple has it; you can watch what happens to automaker share price based on the rumor of a self driving Apple car partnership. 
Depending on your mentality, magic is either a phenomenal thing, completely toxic to the market, a fucking myth, or it doesn‚Äôt exist. GME was magic; that 480 spike was insane; and was based on the prospect of something happening which should never be allowed to happen; infinite gamma squeeze. And now people are sitting around posting SEC fail-to-deliver reporting, wondering where the ace of spades disappeared to. Magic. It can also cut you both ways; LFIN in the ass end of 2018 is a great example.",,

Also, I did make a small mistake in the first response. the option to buy is a ""call"" but you can also have a contract to sell 100 shares at a certain price which is called a ""put"" and would be used if you thought the value of the stock was going to fall significantly.

If you sell a put, get stuck with the shares.. free money for you as long as you can sell them for more then or equal to what you paid for them.
