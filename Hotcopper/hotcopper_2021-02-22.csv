6.6731232e+17,1ronnie,Its Over,"If the US eventually moves to eradicate cash by introducing Digital Dollar which it can control, cryptos are something it cant and that in the longer term would be a threat.Bill Gates says cryptocurrency is one innovation the world could do withoutLast Updated: Feb. 20, 2021 at 9:08 a.m. ETBill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and technological whiz turned philanthropist, may not be a fan of bitcoin and digital-assets.Asked during an interview published on Thursday with The Wall Street Journal what technological advancement the world could do without, Gates had this to say:The way cryptocurrency works today allows for certain criminal activities. It’d be good to get rid of that, he quickly added: I probably should have said bio weapons. That’s a really bad thing.The comments from Gates implies that the billionaire technologists is no bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.94% BTC.1, 2.46% enthusiast but his remarks may simply suggest that he feels that cryptocurrencies are prone to abuse by swindlers and in money-laundering schemes—a common criticism of the decentralized digital asset that was created in 2009.During a CNBC interview that aired on Thursday, Gates adopted a more moderate stance, describing his views on bitcoin as neutral.I don’t own bitcoin, I’m not short bitcoin, so I’ve taken a neutral view, he said in the interview that aired on CNBC’s Sqawk Box show.I do think moving money into a more digital form and getting transaction costs down, that’s something the Gates Foundation does in developing countries, he added.Bitcoin can go up and down just based on the mania or whatever the views are and I don’t have a way of predicting how that will progress, he said.Bitcoin prices have seen parabolic moves of late, despite critics who say that it is a technology looking to solve a problem that doesn’t exist, while using outsize amounts of energy to create a single bitcoin.To be sure, this isn’t the first time, Gates has discussed bitcoin and cryptos but has beliefs have wavered over time. Back in 2018, he said in a separate Squawk Box interview that he would bet against bitcoin if he could.",51211969

6.6730188e+17,Periculum,NEW ASX ADVOCACY GROUP,"Having been in the markets since the 90s, I have seen and experienced much on the boards - so to speak. Some good, some bad and some horrendous.I have contacted the Share holders association, and discovered they are more geared to making money out of membership and courses than representing retail investors who come in many shapes and sizes. They do a very good job at this aspect however they only monitor companies in the ASX200 and from my talks dont really represent mum and dad retail investors.I feel we are at a point where retail investors need to have a genuine VOICE, an advocacy group given the number of Australian individuals that have investments in the ASX or other exchanges.Some facts:- 9 million Australians hold investments outside of their home and super accounts- Of those, 6.6 million hold listed investments- 23% have held their accounts for less than 2 years- 900 thousand Australians plan to begin investing in the next 12 monthsAs a starting point, I believe an advocacy group should look to several issues but not limited to the ones listed. Happy for other thoughts:- Concept of a level playing field- Policing of Listing Rule 3.2- Overseas groups using the Australian market to raise capitol in AU$ that then disappear through failed businesses. (indeed the same issue for locals)- Market manipulation in its various forms- An attempt to protect through rules new investors. This point is especially pertinent given the share market offers the only real place for smaller investors to make money these days and many people as noted by the ASX are getting involved.I have many more thoughts ranging from HFT to fake disclosure by anonymous players but will stop here as a starting point. QUESTIONS1. Do we need a genuine independent voice for the people in share investment?2. What shape should this take?3. What would you like to see this group stand for?These are just some thoughts to reopen this discussion in a different direction. I might start another discussion thread on the same conversation...if anyone is interested.LINK TO REPORT: https://www2.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/blog/ASX-Australian-Investor-Study-2020.pdf",51203487

6.6731316e+17,hashtagyolo,4DS - Anything but Charting,"Originally posted by Brabant90: ↑Symetrix/CEFE Labs versus 4DS ...................- As manyknows, CEFE Labs is a joint venture company owned by ARM and Symetrix that has been set up to developp a new non-volatil memory called CeRam. Ceram has been invented by Professor Araujo of Colorado Uni, more than ten years ago. - After morethan five years of exchange and research with ARM, Professor Araujo, who is theSymetrix CEO, finaly licenced the technology to ARM and they decided to create CEFE Labs to bring the CeRam technology to commercial level. - Beside being(apparently) a serious competitor to 4DS, the CeRam venture presents manyfeatures interesting to understand the 4DS situation/strategy.- First, where4DS like to stay under the radar, The CEFE Labs creation was announced throughan organised PR campaign. The ARM CEO made his announcement october 2 2020, thesame day lots of papers were published in the technical media. The memoryGuy published a very long and interesting paper on Ceram this same day. A paperlike this will need a few days of research, even for them, but it wasbupblished on october 2.- So, solid PRstrategy and money in place. But the most enlighting differences between 4DSand CEFE Labs is their developpement strategy. o Where 4DSkeeps her cards close to her chest, ARM and Symetrix gave the technology to betested by many Fabs and Labs (among wich, Imec that made a few wafers forSymetrix). So a larger and immediat validation of basic principles.o CEFE Labs (asSymetrix), is a private company. They dont have to make CR and fight/explainthings to pesky shareholders. The parent companies : ARM and Symetrix gavehundreds of patents and millions to CEFE Labs. o CEFE Labs istechnicaly more independant. They can make their own 300 mm wafers at home (orat parent Symetrix Lab). ARM gave them the equipement (wich means also Cleanroom, equipments for ultra pure water and other chemicals storage and disposal=> 10 Millions, 20 millions ?)- The otherbig difference is the targeted market. CEFE Labs will first target niche and embededmarket and 4DS want to reach the mass storage and Data centers market. But CEFELabs also said they will leave it to Fab licensees to advance the technologyfor mass storage… Or even S-RAM. Big difference with 4DS who seems to want to giveFabs a complet and detailled recip to produce stacked layers of cells almostimmedialtly, the only things to add being in-house CMOS and packaging.-Onesimilarity between the two projects is that neither CEFE Labs nor 4DS want tomaufacture their product. They will leave it to large manufacturers.Nowabout the respective technologies- There are morequalified people here to compare the two technologies, but I will try to do it,expecting to be corrected by others.- At firstglance, the CeRam technology seems to be impressive and well advanced. Theswiching mecanism is ultra fast : about 100 femtoseconds or less. So muchbetter than 4DS (in nano seconds). But the real speed will be less than thatbecause it will be limited by the CMOS speed, and CMOS is needed to allow thememory to work (the same logic could works for 4DS, though).- The CeRamtechnology seems more elegant, with bulk change and no filament or oxygen atoms exchange. It seems closer to Optane solution Phase change memory (the applied current will change the sandwiched layer from amorphous to cristalin/ conductive and back to amorphous) except that CeRam solution will be much faster. - The CeRamsolution works at high temperatures (Keeps information up to 400° C)- CeRam isbulk change. All the intermediate part between the top and the bottom of thecell will become conductive. So no filament. Professor Araujo made it clearthat CeRam is completly distinc from what he calls the filamentaryparadigm. - 4DS seems tobe in the same situation as it has no filament, but it is unclear if it couldbe assimilated to bulk change.- It is alsounclear at what level of developpment the CeRam technology is.- The ARM CEOspeaks of 18 month to commercial level, but the CEFE Lab CEO speaks about 18month to prove that the device with increasingly small geometry operateas bulk switches and then verify with commercial manufacturers the reliabilityand repeatability of the device in fab-compatible integration at fabdimensions.- As explainedin the Memory Guy paper there are people that says that in fact CeRam do createa filament. That point doesnt seem to be clarified at the moment : As perEenews analog paper ...nonetheless, with decresing geometry it isdifficult to be absolutely sure of the bulk switching effect. And CEFE Lab CEOsaid Until we have something definitiv like X-Ray confirmation, we keeptouching different part of the elephant and every time it is confirmed an elephant.- +++thememoryguy.comhttps://thememoryguy.com/ceram-moves-front-and-center-on-the-nv-memory-stage/- +++ spectrum.ieee.orghttps://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/memory/arm-spinout-details-correlatedelectron-memory-plans- So, theCeRam solution might not be as advanced as some says. In many ways what ispublished about CeRam looks like the datas 4DS published on the early days(2014)- A paperposted on EET Asia in 2014 (at a time when 4DS was still giving data the media) gave the first comparisons between the twotechnologies. It says that 4DS also claims that the operation of its memory isbased on strongly correlated electron-effect Mott Like transition. The CeRamoperation rely also on the same Mott effect. The difference being that theactive material (between the top and the bottom of the cell) is praseodymiumcalcium metal oxyde or praseodimium doped with calcium. The CeRam activematerial is nikel oxyde doped with carbon (they are testing other materials).- +++eetasia.comhttps://archive.eetasia.com/www.eetasia.com/ART_8800697963_499486_TA_b9a57999.HTMhttps://archive.eetasia.com/www.eetasia.com/STATIC/ARTICLE_IMAGES/201405/EEOL_2014MAY14_STOR_TA_01Fig1.jpgWitchone will win the race- If at firstglance the CeRam solution seems to be well advanced, the fact that they arestill trying to figure out what is happening at smaller geometry (Bulk effect ornot), indicate that still have some work to do.- And there noclear information wether CeRam will stack easily. Because they said that theywill first target niche market an embedded, it seems to indicate that they willleave multy layered mass memory for later or more probably for bigmanufacturers licencees to developp it. - All in all4DS seems to have at least two years advance on CEFE Labs CeRam. But CEFE Labshas other products cooking at the moment and they may also like some secrecy andeception. They may surprise everybody with another discovery or a spectacularprogress. Be sure that this will be announced with a powerfull PR operation.Conclusions-The moststriking difference between the two is the power and money behind CeRam. 4DSlooks poor and vulnerable when compared with CEFE Labs. This underline the factthat 4DS cant do it alone (imo). 4DS must rely on HGST, SanDisk and WDC (Imo, 4DS isalready part of WDC sphere and will be absorbed, one way or another).-Thecommercial strategy to impose the thechnology seems more aggressive on the CEFELabs side. They might not be close to a commercial product, but be sure thatanyone will look first on their direction for futur SCM. -That mightnot be enough to win the race. If WDC comes out with an ultra fast commercialproduct based on 4DS ReRam, it might take some very strong positions on SCMmarket before CeRam emerge on this market.-The finalquestion is : what will be the choice ofWDC for their futur SCM ?-We know thatSanDisk had a ReRam solution developped with HPE before being bought by WDC (2layers, 32 GBT, 24 nma). -We know thatHGST had a PCM solution (phase change, like Optane). We dont know wich one isthe most advanced at the moment, but we know that ReRam is the prefered choiceof WDC because of feasability and commercial reasons (could be deployed inrack-scale design and have an ecosystem support).-The WDCsolution was supposed to be revealed in 2017. theregister.comhttps://www.theregister.com/2016/08/16/wd_says_resistance_is_not_futile/Gutfeelings = 4DS people have a real and serious advance, but now a big dog is running andbarking loudly after them.The jury is still out to says if the dog bites.ExpandAre you Steve?Some one has asked Ron a 4DS question at the bottom of that memory guy article...",51212513

Just a supply and demand thing, those two companies have far fewer shares to buy so the price can run very hard. EXR does not have a massive number of SOI in the grand scheme of things either (About 810 million) and 93% of the shares were held by only 954 people according to the last annual report. It would be nice to know how many, and what percentage of holders hold more than 1 million shares.ExpandGotcha, makes sense. Id love to see the latest breakdown, Id expect movement in all brackets? super interesting. Im finding it very hard not to raise capital elsewhere and dump it into EXR.

Quite honestly, I think closing prices would have similar issues to the issues that you see with opening prices.ExpandMy memory is not the best and Ive never been a heavy tipper, so Ive obviously got that closing price entry wrong about Freeholds comp. Not sure I follow the logic on all of that... the only issue I can see if perhaps someone might research a stock after market the same day that they tip and couldnt have possibly entered during the day? In reality, I dont think anyone would generally tip until theyve taken a real entry into a stock anyway, although I guess next day prices separates the paper tippers from those that want to tip their real entries. Shame there isnt a way to enter a tip at your real price by showing your trade confirmation or something... probably would require a lot of manual updating though, so not time feasible.",51204917
