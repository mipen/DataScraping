Reason to Buy Today ..currently $6.75 (2 Day PT: $11... 1-2Mo PT: $20Cup Pattern: ppl are slowly becoming aware of the company and incredible team & pipeline... and the Price has risen to $6.75 (from initial Drop... see below). It now appears likely to complete the run up back to $11 to complete a Cup pattern by End of week (due to no resistance over $7 bc of initial drop). And due to the Cup Depth of $9 ... the rebound from the subsequent handle has a Price Target of $20 (next 1-2 months). At $20 the Market Cap would only be around $400M .. which is likely an accurate current valuation. (Approval of the $7B Phase 3 Drug by EOY would take the share price at very least above $80).  So today is the best timing to get in below $7... and likely take advantage of both the run up to $11 then $20. And be able to hold for bigger potential returns longer term.  Background/ DD:180 Life Sciences (ATNF) is a $125M biotech.  Vanguard acquired over 11% stake last week for 2 of its funds. $7B Anti-TNF Drug will get Phase 3 results later in the year (Highly likely approval). Strong Pipeline. The management Team will literally blow you away....they own over 55% of shares which are locked for 12 months & they are talking no salaries. Also, Anti-TNF Platform trials are fully grant-funded through completion % no offerings for at least 3 years.  Stock is about to form a Cup pattern (Cup/Handle).Management:  ATNF management team is as good as any Large Cap: 2 of the co-founders discovered Anti-TNF Biologics & successfully completed trials phases & approval for the 1st approved Drug in the class- Remicade, which JNJ bought for over $5B. (This class is now the top-selling class of Drugs in the world... ie Remicade, Humira, Enbrel- these 3 alone sold $35B in the US in 2020).  Marc Feldmann won a Lasker award (only 2nd to Nobel) for the discovery.  Anti-TNF is 1 of their 3 platforms.  Another Co-Founder discovered the body's endocannabinoid system & will likely be a 2021 Nobel nominee for formulating synthetic CBD analogs (which is the 2nd of ATNF's platforms).  Additionally, the team collectively have sold Drugs or Companies to JNJ, Amgen, Biogen, and Bristol Myers.. each transaction was over $4B. Team also includes Prior President of Roche Bio, Chair of Clinical research prof at Standford & another with the same title at Oxford. (You can find full bios on 180LifeSciences.com). Initial drop: (why so undervalued currently) The company formed via the merger of 3 small biotech through a SPAC that went public 3 months ago. Due to a long clucky SPAC process, with horrible marketing (everyone thought this was a european pot stock bc the company being acquired was listed as CannaRX Bio- b/c that happen to be the 1 used for paperwork name. Combined this with an offering that included Rights & Warrants, and the multiple extensions- the price of Right & Warrant remained very low & on merge day, when Right converted- the Share Price dropped below $3.  This had nothing to do with the fundamental of the company- but rather an awful SPAC process (the SPAC manager is no longer associated with the company and sold most of her shares past several months (prob to avoid a lawsuit)."

This is from their  last QREDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 11, 2021 /Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY) (Biotricity or the Company), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly resultsYear-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks, stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter, said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model. We are pleased with our results and look forward to further progress in upcoming quarters."

Apprenty they have a very strong product also. A fair few people seem to see a merger coming, others just seem assured by strong fundamentals and tangential factors such as they are now operating in Israel which is about to legalise in August. There are even rumours of a short squeeze because, before the current CEO Beena, the company apparently was run pretty terribly in 2018/2019, and was shorted heavily.  All in all, there is a lot to make of what could happen. Certainly, I am a complete novice with weed stocks.

Please note everything is red,Reddit_pennystocks_2021-02-18.csv,REDDIT,COM,"I just want put it out there that I in my opinion part of the reason the market has been so red is because of all the panic selling during low volume hours. Typical conventional wisdom is don't panic sell during lunch because there is always a dip in price because of the drop in volume, well the same concept applies to after hours/ premarket. Having robinhood on your phone is great because you can look at your positions 24/7, but I think it is also terrible because it becomes impossible to stop staring at the price and it causes millions of people to panic sell during times when there isn't the volume to absorb the selling."

I see red days as “Special Discount Days” if there is a stock you have been waiting to buy and has been red for a day or two,  take advantage of dip. The market will go back up and even higher then it was before. Always hold and don’t panic sell. Remember the classic line:“Buy low, sell high”"

Please note everything is red,Reddit_pennystocks_2021-02-18.csv,REDDIT,COM,"The market is making a steady climb to a bullish peak before it turns bearish for the year. (Happens annually). Check it out:When you are done trading for the day, set a chart to the symbol $SPXL (It follows the S&P) in the following configuration:Time frame = 5 Years. Frequency =  Weekly.MACD on (default settings); RSI on (default settings); Slow stochastic on (Default settings).Volume not relevant in this research case.As you can see, the S&P as viewed through $SPXL is headed to an apex.  My personal opinion is that when the annual bear dip does happen it will not be dramatic (We have already taken the economic hit with Covid) but rather a steady downward stair-step of dips and spikes, not falling further than a rising support line e.g.  bull peak of 8/2020? If you were to look at it from a slow stochastic perspective, not dipping below 40.  RSI somewhere around 40.00, and MACD not below -2.00. If that were to be the actual case, it would be a perfect trading scenario for riding the bear dip profitably i.e. slow and steady.Then again I could be clueless and all hell breaks loose or it's into the stratosphere of riches for everyone!"

I've made a few good trades and am in the green overall but I have more shares I've bought at a loss than I've bought for a gain. So like most things in life, I started betting against myself to succeed. I take the stock I would have purchased expecting to make a profit based on DD (and gut feeling) and then short sell it instead. Then buy to cover when I hit my target gain (or in the case it rises, after I lose X%). I've just been doing it with small amounts so I don't dig myself into a hole should the stock rise exponentially, but I've been more profitable this way.Downside is with penny stocks, brokers don't always let you short them depending on the market, and for the ones you can the shortable shares are often depleted or come with a higher interest rate. And it's a bigger gamble, since if the price goes up, it can theoretically gain infinitely which you'll owe your broker the difference. This is why I'm practicing shorting using small amounts. But in general I make more profitable trades this way, even if I'm not brave enough to use larger amounts or stick around for longer-term shorts than a day."

They're tech is super impressive! I remember last year being shown renders of multibeam scans simaler to what they're doing, and the difference between that and the resolution of what kraken has produced is like night and day.

I have a question about the SAS system.It seems like the imagery of the rope on the sea floor is astounding in quality. Do you know if this is a sonar based image that they use software to enhance? (reduce noise and amplify true signal?) The reason I'm asking is because you also mention SeaVision, a new underwater five dimensional imaging system (X, Y, Z, Time and Wavelength) that uses a laser to point scan objects so that 3D models of them can be made. I'm wondering if they are adapting the SAS system to include the laser based system. If they build a laser-integrated SAS system I can see almost every boat being equipped with that in the future."

Turning out to be an expensive mistake. I've only been trading for about a year so I get fear of heights when a stock has ran up a lot. But clearly some stocks can run far before they dip so I think I need to learn to let runners run and  not be so afraid to buy into strength. Last week I was thinking of buying back into riot but instead I bought xpev since figured it was near support and more fair value or whatever. Well it turns out that that stock has no momentum at the moment and just keeps going lower so that didn't turn out well.

How To Avoid FOMO And Other Syndromes,Reddit_pennystocks_2021-02-18.csv,REDDIT,COM,"Fair enough, I would completely agree with that.  At the same time, looking at the past performance is a pretty good proxy and when I am trying to sort through 50 or 100 stocks to see which ones I really want to dig in on... looking at the past performance is an imperfect but relatively accurate way to do an initial weeding.  But like you said, if you feel good about a stock's valuation (not its past history/momentum), that is the most important factor.And, I always like to see a little upward momentum before I decide to make the plunge jump.  It is one thing to jump in after it triples because you want to get the next time it triples.. but if there is a 10-20% jump that coincides with some online chatter, that may be a good indication it is about to pop.  When I have tried to go back and examine the patterns of stocks that I missed, it seldom goes from no movement at all to tripling in one step.  There is usually a prelude move and then there is a jump.  I have been working on trying to identify the companies that interest me and that I think have a good case for buying... and then watching for the early move."

Based on the comments and recommendations made by the DMC, which is further supported by the June 2020 FDA guidance document titled, “Statistical Considerations for Clinical Trials During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency,” we have amended the DMC charter to enable a “superiority” review at 65% of the expected events rather than 75% as originally planned. The protocol, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), and the DMC charter have been amended to reflect that change. To counter the impact of COVID-19, we have aggressively pursued outreach programs with webinars and other remote communications, and have now been able to add randomized patients bringing us closer to the number of events for the “superiority” analysis and to schedule a meeting with the DMC, both expected in the second quarter of 2021."

It would need to pass high bars to satisfy physicians since biofilms are notoriously resistant to remove once in place. if a bacteria sets up shop on a piece of foreign hardware in the body (artificial joint, artificial valve, large IV(catheter), etc) then no amount of antibiotics will remove it.

In the case of large catheters, the bacteria can build up on the tip of it and shower bacteria into the blood stream causing sepsis or distant infections around the body.  So a product that removed biofilm is very exciting but also has to do something nothing has done before.  (Mino-Lok is 100% effective)not until the large well designed blinded randomized controlled studies say so.  Plus nothing is 100% in medicine.  And, they are also making a hemorrhoid cream....."

You might be feeling anxiety, but what time frame is your loss over? A day? A Week? that's nothing. Too early to say if you're investment was good or bad (unlesss you lock in losses/gains). never trade on FOMO or emotions - if its trending on reddit good chance itll crash/dip within a week. Statistically, you'll be making more just buying in as you can, rather than trying to DCA. On a red day i might take some profits from anything that only dipped ~1% and buy those 5% dips. But keeping 20% cash on hand to buy dips feels safe. If you can't handle the pressure, throw everything in VTI and peace out."

New CEO. Increased his holdings in the firm’s stock last week. Influx of cash from recent offerings last week. Firm consistently lowered operating expenses and increased R&D spending through Covid. They have trimmed a lot of fat in the past year since being slammed by the opioid crisis... all of which seems to be behind them. Plenty of DD on this if you search $ASRT and want to confirm. Went down a rabbit hole this weekend and I like the thesis. IMO not just a short term play on NASDAQ compliance. We will see.

The March 19th calls with a strike price of $3 is going for $18 a contract. If you were to buy the call it would cost you $18. Well someone’s got to sell you something in order for you to buy it. So I would sell $3 March 19th call and collect a $18 premium for every 100 shares. Your shares get locked as collateral and if the stock doesn’t hit that strike price you get your shares back. One thing that is guaranteed is the premium. Regardless you get the premium of $18 for every 100 shares. So I would sell 5,000 shares and collect $750 in premium that I could use to buy more stocks or deposit into my bank account."

Stock goes to $1.60, contract executed. You now have $155 (selling shares plus premium)2. Stock goes to $100 per share, contract executed. You now have $155 same as 1 (but you could have had a lot more)3. Stock stays under $1.50, contract expires. You have 100 stock and $5.

Based on the DD, they are growing revenue quickly which justifies their valuation. I personally think RIOT and Marathon Parent Group are overvalued and could pull back given their valuation. There is a premium for bitcoin related stocks, and this company is literally 1/3 the size in market cap and 1/10 the multiple that $RIOT has (which is cheaper than $MARA). So, I don't think it's overvalued at all at the moment.I don't know what to say about the LSE vs. OTC comment, the prices have normalized it would appear.Finally, bitcoin mining margins are improving for Argo it appears, with their highest margin reported in January. It may be the case that bitcoin mining is low margin, but at least Argo is doing something to keep the margin up.

You should read up on how blockchain encryption works so you can understand the vulnerabilities. If you don't want to do that, here is some good light reading, but there are hundreds of whitepapers on this, don't take my word for it.​Bitcoin uses something called the Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to sign digital signatures, and uses a cryptography standard called SHA-256 to hash blocks on the chain. With Bitcoin, a private key, picked at random, is run through these algorithms to generate a public key. And the Bitcoin protocol uses the hash value of this to create a public Bitcoin address. A quantum computer could reverse this process and derive the private key from a public one. And voila! Bitcoin’s claim of inviolability and unhackability is gone, and you have access to any Bitcoin wallet you want. Two major quantum algorithms that threaten the current state of cryptography have already been developed: Grover's and Shor's algorithms.Rob Campbell, President at Baltimore, Maryland-based Med Cybersecurity, told Decrypt that quantum computers using both Grover’s and Shor’s algorithm could also “mine much faster than everyone else, and therefore an adversary could insert its own blocks and undermine the entire blockchain.” ​https://decrypt.co/28560/quantum-computers-could-crack-bitcoins-encryption-by-2022"

(2) Their CEO does have a proven track record, in an industry that shares a lot of traits with retail marijuana. (3) There will likely be ongoing good news - pandemic easing is good for pot sales in Canada, and it seems likely there is some move or other afoot using their refilled cash reserves.My belief is that this share will shake off the majority of its pump&dump adherents when it creeps its way up toward $0.40 and then contracts. Institutional investors will capture the shares because of the fundamentals being sound and because of their comparative information advantage widening each day past earnings. The long ride pump & dumpers will probably exit at $1.00, and this stock will just keep on going up after that contraction unless there are any major missteps, eventually trading in the multiple dollars range.I think."

I'm in for another 6k shares at open tomorrow.   It's a gamble with fairly low volume and a trash website without much interesting insight. My instinct is that it's getting a little push from the ILED and SGE acquisitions, but those were small acquisitions (maybe $15MM reasonably added to the market cap) that don't justify the current wave. I see more that it's riding the meme wave with its recent name change. I'm not above gambling with short term P&Ds, but I'm trying to figure out if there's more to this company than I'm seeing. The chart looks neutral to bearish to me,  so I'm buying into the hype despite my brain trying to talk me out of it.I have my sell limit set at just over $0.05 (which would be an amazing increase), but I'm wondering if you have insight that I'm lacking that would suggest that it's rocketing further than that, that I should hold longer, or that my PT is way too ambitious.

So short term that’s bad for stock price as I’m currently sitting at 47c a share. But long term it means that it should rise with large backing from an established entity like BMO.
