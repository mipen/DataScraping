~5 years ago I got a mortgage at just under 4% and car loans in the low 2% range. Now a car loan with the same credit is around 4% and mortgages are in the mid 2% range. Why? Shouldn't those rates maintain some kind of gap and move in relative lockstep?

Something I'm not understanding in the IPO process.
Basically - from what I understand - an IPO works like this. A company wants to raise money by going public. They hire an ibank as a market maker. The ibank goes to its clients (HNWIs, institutional investors, etc.) and says ""hey - this company wants to go public, here's a pitch deck of what the value prop is - would you like to invest?"" (Roadshow.) If there's enough interest, it will take the company public and pocket a % of the capital raised as a fee.
Here's what I don't understand. Where exactly does the ""public"" come in?
The company wishing to go public will have raised $ through the investors who bought in during the roadshow. When the stock gets listed those investors will be under a lock up period. 
From what I understand the ibank will also ""underwrite"" or guarantee a certain number of shares will sell by buying up the spread between what the roadshow investors buy and the target # of shares the company wishes to sell. Where then, does the public money go? Does it go back to the ibank? When the stock opens for trading and the public buys shares what's happening? The company has already raised its money. The ibank (if the deal wasn't fully subscribed) may be on the hook for a little bit. But is the ibank the other side of the deal when you and I buy stock? If so, at what point does the ibank stop receiving a % of the stock transactions? Is that part of the lockup agreement?",,

For example “FTSE All-World index series” https://is.gd/CefZVG https://is.gd/CXtW7o 
(used by Vanguard ETF VWRL) it’s defined as:
“The FTSE All-World Index is a market-capitalisation weighted index representing the 
performance of the large and mid cap stocks from the FTSE Global Equity Index Series and 
covers 90-95% of the investable market capitalisation. The index covers Developed and 
Emerging markets [...]”
Are indexes trailing behind on the adjustment for China growth? Considering that is going to be the biggest economy in the world by 2028 and accounts already for about 17% of the World GDP?
Or instead indexes consider only what is the stock market size by country and so the key word is “investable”? 
Checking the 2020 monthly factsheet for the example index (FTSE All-World Index) I can see that from January to November China % weight went from 3,89% to 5,16%, still I don’t get why such a small percentage compared to the size of China GDP in relation to the world as a whole.

I understand that when yields fall this is an indicator and effect of investors higher demand for bonds and as a result bond prices rise. Generally investors are piling into bonds as a safe haven asset and money  flows from riskier asset classes like equities to bonds?
So if this is true then the falling yields during corona, should mean that money has been flowing into bonds, correct? 
I have a hard time understanding this with the background of the general sentiment that during corona investors apparantly have been piling into equities FROM bonds due to falling interest rates and yields in bonds? Thus explaining the huge rally in equities. 
The only explanation I see is that money has been flowing into BOTH equities and bonds during corona, because of falling yields and a huge rally in equities? Where am I going wrong?",,

Why can the expected return be higher when the investor is willing to take on more risk? Isn’t risk or volatility just a measure of dispersion?
Suppose Investor A buys a stock having a risk higher than that of a risk-free asset (r_A > r_f) and Investor B buys another stock which has a correlation of -1 with Investor A’s stock, so the risk of Investor B is the same.
But if risk premium means higher expected return, both Investors A and B will have a positive expected return. This can’t be true. The sum of their profits will always be zero.

Suppose there was N players each getting various non-monetary assets.
Players can hand over one another the items with certain limitation. Player X could only give Player Y gift, if X holds ""care-stone"" and gives it to Y with the gift.
I think there may emerge some sort of will in individual to pass the ""care-stone"" with the item to someone else as quickly as possible in order to make it able to return with gift. People would try to get rid of items useless to them but they would not accept every gift from others but only most valuable or useful ones. Also people would try to make the ratio of care-stones to gift given to them as big as possible, so would rather accept big package of material with one care-stone than small one etc.
I was just thinking about concept of ""gift economy reverse money"". Money is mostly social practice or institution based on shared trust right? I was just thinking maybe we could come up with different kind of practice than we curently have. Could the above mentioned system function and be based on players trust? There is not meant to be any outside party forcing people to follow the rule about care-stones. People are meant to follow the rule about care-stone out of their own understanding of its beneficency. Would players have motivation to engage in that system? My idea was that players know that if the gift economy moves, they benefit from it because they get rid of what they dont need and acquire what they do need. Player could arive at idea that system will work only if other players will believe it will work and in the same time he could see them ariving at the same idea and his own yet unknown believe being constructive for saturation of their believe, therefore he would see it is not sure it would work but it can only work if he decides to try it and take a leap of faith.

I have a limited understanding about finances and the stock market, but given the current development I'd like to take the opportunity to educate myself.
Now I am wondering about the percentage of shorted stocks being public. Since it is public knowledge how many GME stocks were shorted (>100%), isn't it mathematically a winning strategy to just buy all of the stocks (given enough capital) and sell them for a ridiculous high amount?
Even if I don't know when the shorted stocks are due, I just have to make sure the company does not go bankrupt and eventually I will be able to generate profit. Obviously this cannot be done by the average person, but seeing how there are billionaires, why would they not follow this strategy?
Side note: If this strategy was to work, could I, once I have 100%, sell the stock for a ridiculous high amount and force everyone who shorted it to go bankrupt?",,

Here —-
“And with so many short squeeze situations simultaneously happening, it is likely that every single bank who acts as a prime broker for these different short sellers who are sold short on different stocks has exposure to all of this risk. Risk that they cannot even cover themselves.
So the end result of all of this is likely going to be that every single investment bank in the country with exposure to this risk, which could be every single investment bank in the country, is forcibly liquidated. It’s an even worse situation for the banks than the housing crash because in 2008 their level of exposure was actually limited, in this situation it is theoretically UNlimited. 
Check all of the big investment bank stocks they’ve all been down for several days in a row. At this point in the game, it seems very likely that their going straight into the ground.”",,

I'm reading The Creature From Jekyll Island, a book about the Federal Reserve. It makes the case that the Fed is essentially a bank cartel.
The book states that when a bank makes a loan, the loan is recorded both as an asset and a liability. It is recorded as an asset because the money is earning interest. It is also recorded as a liablilty because:
""...the newly created checkbook money is now in circulation, and most of it will end up in other banks which will return the canceled checks to the issuing bank for payment. Indivuals may also bring some of this checkbook money back to the bank and request cash.""
I'm assuming it's just a check? Why use the phrase checkbook money? I googled around and didn't really find a clear definition for this particular term.
My understanding though is that the loan is recorded as a liability because the bank wrote a check for the disbursement and someone could come cash the check on demand at any time.",,

So no one is talking about Italian debt no one is talking about European Central bank no one is talking about what the financial Achilles heel is no one is talking about the financial markets in respect of risk again stress tests as the pandemic as it has wreaked havoc upon most of the hospitality, airlines and other associated industries.
18% of all US dollars were printed in 2017 the propensity to spend is with as Biden has said the lowest earners and the most at risk so his quantitive easing package of $1.9 trillion is correct.
The bounceback curve has not seen the dead cat bounce other than a small return shortly after the first current financial nosedive.
I saw the crash coming because of a 68% drop in oil consumerism in China alone. BP and Shell both have had huge revenue drops since the first wave of the pandemic this was to me was obvious. But now so many people are testing in the financial markets because they have expendable cash flow not because they are clever investors. And because historically if you invest in a crash you make lots of money.
The financial markets are savage on the people that perhaps don’t play the safe game is that our Achilles heel.
To invest in China is madness no one can trust the figures. the companies who hold the most value are state owned and the Chinese government just keeps on printing money without acceptable Accountancy indicators on their accounts.
Effectively Chinese companies could pluck a figure from the sky and say that’s what they are and no one can indicate whether those returns are factual because of the tight financial restraints held by the government.
Major US companies have held onto liquid cash to increase the value of the dollar many streams are flowing upwards and not being re-distributed as they don’t need to because they hold such strong product and marketing expertise.
No one is talking about state owned Debt.
The UK government is talking about Negative interest rates. This only hurt the people with the least propensity to save as the companies have Hoarded
cash since the last financial economic crash.
This was due simply to D risking.
So what’s my point well many of the majors haven’t started to ask their suppliers for cost reductions so that they can keep their shareholders happy with the high returns they saw a few years ago also most corporations haven’t released their financial statements especially at the lower 350 FTSE mark.
The markets are still propped up by government and sovereign fund intervention and people that do have money I still throwing it at stupid stocks.
no one has been reporting on the losses and riveters market which is worth five times that of all the companies that exist so what are the losses if you hedged on oil another 68% drop even if you manage to risked what are the losses still a lot of those derivatives have not been paid out yet a lot of those people will not until the year and declare losses even the small business",,

What do you think would happen if after the deal goes through, everyone just unfollowed the page? 
One could assume Warner put up that kind of cash to secure an audience immediately, and perhaps push their own agenda or promotional venues. In my mind, if people just unfollowed the page they would outright lose money right?

AIUI, rebalancing to 50-50 would minimize risk, because I don't get overexposed to one particular fund. Sure. But this paper seems to claim that it's also good for increasing expected returns because it minimizes risk drag, which I can't quite wrap my head around. Is it true?",,

Background: I recently graduated from college (within the last year) and have been working and stockpiling cash. I currently have approximately $25,000 cash (held in a money market account). I am facing a few different scenarios and I am struggling to find which is best to delve into my real estate career. I am 24 and live in the Chicagoland area and desire to live downtown this summer. Any advice and opinions are greatly appreciated.
Scenario 1: My friends are asking me to move into an apartment. I know that paying rent is semi-foolish but I know that it would be an incredible time and memories that I’d have forever. I would then build my portfolio while living there and eat the ~$10-12,000 in rent per year.
Scenario 2: House-Hack and try to find a place on the North Side that is within budget. Only downside is that this is extremely difficult in Chicago given the current market and high prices. Realistically, to cash flow I may need to live in a surrounding suburb of Chicago or get lucky with finding an amazing deal. Or, just buy a beater and fix her up - however there really are no beaters in the Northern neighborhoods (e.g. Lincoln Park, Old Town) 
Scenario 3: I would buy a 1 bed 1 bath apartment/condo so that I would at least build equity while still living downtown in the neighborhood by my friends. I would then be able to build my real estate portfolio from my own home. 
Your advice is greatly appreciated in advance.",,

Banks borrow money directly from the federal reserve at a federal funds rate. Based on this, banks charge consumers higher rates than they borrowed at. This is why yield curves are important and duration of bonds. The 30 year Treasury bill is much lower than it was 5 years ago. This reflects mortgage rates being lower now.

Typically, you don't see mortgages having higher rates than car loans. I've never seen car loans in the 2% range honestly. I can't speak to this specific circumstance. I do know that car loan rates are higher because they are set at the prime rate, which is typically 3% higher than the feds fund rate.
However, the interest on car loans and mortgage loans being much closer can be explained by the yield curves flattening and even inversing for a short awhile. Investopedia is a great resource for learning about different formations of yield curves. It has its criticisms for being a predictor of recessions, but there is correlation there. 

People continue to buy bonds in high risk environments because it is considered to be a safe asset. Uncertainty causes people to flood bonds in a demand wave. This causes bond rates to go down and prices of bonds to go up. For bonds, price of the bond and yield of the bond have inverse relationships. I know yields are low right now, but it's better to gain 1% rather than lose 20% in the mind of a more cautious investor expecting the worst.",,

Very surprised (impressed?) you saw car loans at 2% simultaneously lower than mortgage rates. I'm thinking this is misremembering or, assuming you're right, maybe the rates you saw were contingent on other items.
No, for a few reasons.


Sovereign bonds (U.S. or otherwise) are still seen as lower-risk investments, able to weather storms other asset classes can't. 
Yields this low suggests something has to break. That may be the world around these bonds, or it could be the bonds themselves. Are you willing to bet against large, mature governments compared to ""off-the-hook"" markets?
In the case of low or negative yields, I think people (institutions and individuals) are taking a different approach than usual. The ""usual"" is ""I won't earn much, but at least it's something."" The ""different"" is ""I'm not earning anything, or I'm losing a little, but at least I'm not losing a lot.""


In addition to this, fixed income markets have some notable inefficiencies, including major market players that are required, legally, to purchase investment-grade bonds (insurance cos., banks, pension funds, some other funds, etc.).",,

Generally car loans are riskier and therefore would carry a higher rate on the same maturity. I assume your mortgage has a much longer maturity than your car loan, as a result the rate could be higher due to a steeper yield curve. 2 things happened in since 5 years ago, 1. The yield curve flattened significantly. 2. House prices increased, reducing the risk of the underlying of the mortgage while car sales slumped, increasing the risk there. As a result you see tge rates you saw.
For one, negative nominal rates do not mean negative real rates. The markets are likely pricing in deflation. Secondly, as mentioned before, institutions have mandates regarding asset allocation. Some may stop buying as they have mandates requiring positive yields, others don't care. If you look at EUR and JPY bonds, there have been negative yielding (nominal) instruments for years, yet demand has remained very high.",,

Where exactly does the ""public"" come in?

Public investors meaning retail investors. More importantly, company shares are now publicly available, meaning the share value theoretically will be dictated by free market supply and demand. Even more importantly, the company itself must also make MANY more public disclosures about its financials and outlook, amongst other things.
 

Where then, does the public money go? Does it go back to the ibank?

This is a great question (if I'm interpreting what you really want to ask correctly). It depends on what the type of sale the underwriter has agreed to (wiki this later). Long story short, this is often the ""relationship"" side of the process, as the underwriter will often have a list of clients who will make offers that may or may not be ""hard"" offers. In a bought deal, the underwriter physically owns the shares, so the exchange of shares to client is straightforward. In a traditional bookrun deals, it's based on offers from clients, who may or may not pay for the shares in advance. Depending on the agreement between underwriter and issuer, money from these investors ultimately either goes directly to the issuer or to the underwriter (if the underwriter has already hard purchased the shares from the issuer).
 

When the stock opens for trading and the public buys shares what's happening? But is the ibank the other side of the deal when you and I buy stock? If so, at what point does the ibank stop receiving a % of the stock transactions? Is that part of the lockup agreement?

Not sure what exactly you're asking. After the shares hit the exchange, whoever is the OWNER of the shares of the stock is the other side of the deal when you and I try to buy stock. It could be the bank that's selling you shares, but you very likely won't know. Lockup agreements have absolutely nothing to what you've mentioned.",,

I haven't dug into this index composition/prospectus, but yes.

You see a home you like. 
You decide you want to make an offer. 
Your agent does a market analysis to determine a fair value (which may or may not be close to the list price)
You decide what you want to offer and write out a formal contract with your offer price. 
Seller either signs your offer agreeing to your price or submits a counter offer to you. 
You decide if you want to sign the counter offer and agree to the price or if you want to submit another counter. (There is no set number of times you will counter back and forth. I have seen people counter back and forth based on stupid shit like whether or not furniture will be left in the home or whether a light will be fixed)
Once you have an agreement on price and terms, earnest money is due. 
Realtor orders an inspection. You get your mortgage application submitted. Mortgage company or your realtor submits the order for title work with the title company.
Mortgage company works on clearing conditions from your approval. Once all conditions are cleared, you get the ""clear to close."" (Conditions will be things like a satisfactory appraisal being done, you submitting paperwork like paystubs and W2s, the property having a clear title)
You close. Normally that means buyer and seller meeting at the listing agent or your agent's office to sign paperwork. You either wire your down payment and closing costs to the title company or bring a check for it to closing (NEVER ACCEPT WIRE INSTRUCTIONS OVER EMAIL. THIS IS A COMMON SCAM. ALWAYS CALL THE TITLE COMPANY FOR WIRE INSTRUCTIONS). The mortgage company wires the mortgage amount to the title company. 
You get the keys. Title company disperses money. Seller gets their proceeds, appraiser gets their piece, county/city get their piece, agents get their piece, etc.",,

I am a beginner when it comes to trading.

Learn wtf options are and how they fucking work. I don't just mean ""I can draw the nice little graphs."" I mean liquidity, black-scholes, etc.
All of your options are ITM. If you have the capital, you can exercise the options. Given you're 24, you likely don't have this. Ergo, you'll have to sell.
Assuming you sell right before expiration, you can expect a measurable haircut compared to the prices Robinhood is quoting you right now. Why? Because the profit of the option is just about fixed at that point. You'll still (likely) make money. 
Assuming you sell some time before expiration, you may be able to get closer to the RH quote (albeit the RH quote may be lower than right before expiration) as there is still some time to get more ITM.",,

I didn't knew that brokers also gave research analysis to PMs.

 
You usually have sell side sales teams (the S in S&T) do this, although a lot of places are compressing the role of research and sales together to save costs.
 

Then what is the role of a buy side research analyst then? Isn't he totally useless in this case?

 
Quite a few differences, but here are some listed: 

Buyside research analysts generally have FAR superior data/information advantages over most sell side analysts.
Buyside research analysts primarily aid directly or indirectly (depending on the shop your at) in idea generation for trades, whereas sell side research analysts primarily aid in initiating and continuing coverage for public companies.
Buyside research is RARELY seen by or distributed to the public, and essentially keeps the shops alive and competitive. Sell side research generally NEEDS to be available to the public.",,

An issue is detected and/or predicted in the markets.
Risky assets are sold out of, and risk-off assets are purchased. This lowers yields.
Central banks step in and attempt to stabilize markets. They do so via purchasing treasuries, potentially further lowering yields.
The central bank activity results in two things:

Yields are so low as to cause concern over inflation.

This results in reallocating ""up the risk ladder"" towards riskier assets, including stocks.

Lower rates increase the demand for risk assets both via valuation metrics by discounting future flows at a lower rate, and by supply and demand by forcing more investors to reach for yield/returns in riskier assets.

Is it possible for a wealthy/rich person to give away most, if not all their money? 

Yes you can do whatever you want with your money

Would that be considered reckless? 

Yes

How would yearly taxes play a factor in this? 

In your jackpot example, you would pay income tax on the jackpot, and then income tax on any income generated via things like investing the money. You would still owe other taxes like property tax etc where applicable

Would they go bankrupt?

Can you explain ETF fees and how and where they’re deducted from?

 
ETFs and funds in general have what's called a NAV (you can just google your relevant ETF + NAV for the number). This stands for NET Asset Value. So here is where the ETF fees are deducted from.
 
Say a fund holds 100% AAPL in its portfolio and charges you 0.50% ANNUAL expense ratio. Beginning of the year, let's say the fund has a total 100 shares issued trading at 100 dollars, so $10,000 total NAV beginning of the year. You buy ALL 100 shares of this fund for $10,000, and this fund is invests all it's funds in AAPL (so $10k worth of AAPL). End of year, let's say AAPL has stayed the EXACT same price. You're thinking to yourself, ok so my 100 shares in this fund should be the same value right? No. Your 100 shares of the fund is worth $9,950 instead of your expected $10,000 because you needed to pay $50 worth of expenses. The NAV of the fund at the end of the year is $9,950, even though it's holding $10,000 worth of AAPL stock. This fee are usually deducted daily from NAV prorated (i.e 0.50%/250 * Average assets for the day).
 
Here's the kicker. People might STILL pay $100 per share ON THE MARKET for that fund, even though its NAV suggests only $99.50 per share. So this is why you might be confused, because you're looking at the market price for the ETF and not its NAV.
 

Also when people say the expense ratio compounds what does that mean?

 
Simply put, if an expense ratio is fixed for the fund, as the fund appreciates, you will pay more $ amount in expenses. 0.50% of 10k is obviously less expensive than 0.50% of 50k, which would happen if AAPL increased by 5X (using the same example). Same logic applies to a savings account, only difference is you'd be benefitting from the compounding vs. paying it.",,

why would they not follow this strategy?

 
If we're talking theory, it's mathematically winning only if you can acquire the shares for more than what you would get after force liquidating the short sellers afterwards. The first problem is that if the market catches onto your intention to do this, they will simply hold their shares and create a pseudo bidding war between you and the existing shorts (who will need to cover). The second problem is that even if you're successful somehow in getting all the shares, your only buyers left after this will be the short sellers that have to cover.

I understand the basics of, lets say, buying and exercising a call options contract - you pay for the contract, wait for the underlying security to rise above strike price, at which point you're in the money, execute contract, now you own the shares

 
It's almost never a good idea to exercise your option prior to expiration.

Being able to turn around sell protection to a fund allowed him to balance his book somewhat and lock in some of those gains. The BB bank trading desks are acting as market makers, and while they do often end up with directional positions and warehoused risk, they prefer to lay off the risk and just make the bid/offer spread. This is a simplified explanation, since when you get into complex OTC products of the kind being traded on credit desks back in those days there were very few truly offsetting trades a lot of proxy hedges, or hedging first order risk by taking higher order risk, etc, but that is the basic concept.",,

If you need the accuracy, you can use a yield curve to run your DCF with a term structure of rates, but I think most of the time you can just use the rate that corresponds the term of the asset (ie. use the 10 year rate if it is a DCF over 10 years) and ignore the interim term structure.

Valuation focuses more on finding the intrinsic value of a company. Private Equity is probably the biggest user of valuation. I'd personally go for Damodaran's material as he has a lot of online material to supplement his books, including a YouTube channel. I don't know how familiar you are with valuation, so I'll give you a link to his beginner book on Google books, and his website.
Statistics route focuses more on performance metrics, and how stocks work together to manage risk and generate growth. ETFs use this route the most. Since you have a background in math I'd recommend going to something like ETF.com and looking at the methodologies behind Smart Beta ETFs and/or their indices. I'll provide you with USMV (iShares Minimum Volatility) as an example. Their index is the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility index. You can find the methodology in a PDF link on the MSCI website. Once you get a handle on this you can try making your own portfolios with different factors. For risk management, this link for basic risk management metrics is a good starting point. Common trading metrics / performance indicators can be found easily for any stock on Morningstar (under key ratios) and/or Yahoo finance (under statistics); you can Google the ones you're interested.",,

Futures are simply an agreement to buy (sell) a specific thing at a set price on a given date.
There can many advantages to using futures.
One example could be you have a sketch making company that uses a certain amount of pencils every month. You could go out and buy the pencils you need each month, but that creates risk to your business if that price moves around a lot. So entering into futures contracts to buy pencils at a set price each months protects you from big losses if the price of pencils goes way up because of outside factors.
Another example could be that you run a fund that invests in writing instruments. You need a position in pencils. You could go buy a lot of pencils, but then you have to have somewhere to store them, and you need to keep them sharpened. Or you could enter into a futures contract which is cash settled, so you just exchange money at expiration based on the closing price of pencils.
These are just a couple of made up illustrations, but hopefully you get the point.",,

Okay - 
So I think if understand this correctly -
In a bought deal the underwriter simply buys all the shares of the company. And pays to the company the capital the company wants to raise. (Which reduces the financing risk but also reduces the amount of $ the company could raise by letting the markets hash out the fair price. On the other hand - it also puts a backstop on the loss if the company let's the markets hash out the price and the market believes the company's value proposition is dog shit.)
In contrast - when there is a preliminary prospectus filing, the underwriter DOESN'T buy the issuing company's stock. Then the company's valuation is at the mercy of the market. (But again, backstopped to some extent by the underwriter.)
That's all super helpful and may help better frame my question -
Basically what I'm trying to ask is - presumably, if the company takes the latter route and files for a preliminary prospectus, how does the company ensure that it receives the money it raises?
I think I answered my own question - 
Basically, when trading starts, the sell side of the shares are all owned by the issuing company. When you or I buy shares, the money we spend (rather than being transferred to a private owner) is transferred to the company's treasury account, thereby raising the money.
Bonus follow up question - How much of the stuff about roadshows is correct? Do IPOs typically raise some mix of the money through private placements as well? Pre-prospectus shopping? Or is this only applicable to private fundraising?",,

how does the company ensure that it receives the money it raises?

It doesn't (see wework as an example of a recent failed IPO), but assuming the deal has gone through, the answer is that the underwriter is responsible for ensuring the company gets paid.
 

When you or I buy shares, the money we spend (rather than being transferred to a private owner) is transferred to the company's treasury account, thereby raising the money.

No. That number, which you see on the balance sheet as paid-in capital, is the IPO offer price reported to the SEC & listed exchange BEFORE it actually trades (usually a day before). It's a one time thing. Before the first trading day starts, the shares will already NOT belong to the issuer. In sum, the issuer will already raised that amount (minus fees) from the underwriter. If the underwriter and the issuer can't agree on this number, IPO fails to go through.
 

How much of the stuff about roadshows is correct?

 
Literally, the roadshow is just a marketing effort that serves as a mutual way to gauge interest between issuer and buyers. Relationships are EXTREMELY important at this phase for obvious reasons, and many times a syndication of underwriters will help with this.
 

Do IPOs typically raise some mix of the money through private placements as well? Pre-prospectus shopping? Or is this only applicable to private fundraising?

 
For starters, an IPO is the exact opposite of a private placement. The vast majority of companies filing for IPO will have raised some sort of money beforehand through private placements (i.e your VC alphabets Series A,B,C, etc). Once a company is public, the simple rule is that you cannot raise money through private placement anymore.
 
This point here is very key. While the underwriter won't change the price once it's declared, WHO the underwriter allocates shares to will be a factor. Hence, even if the shares are ""available"" to the public, it's often not really true because the underwriter will simply prefer to allocate the shares to it's own network of clients/institutional investors who they want to maintain a relationship with.",,

In this situation, let's simplify by saying the AAPL price stays the same forever. You will then ALWAYS see the NAV of the fund decrease (Asset amount stays the same, but expenses still there), but the PRICE of the ETF may or may not decrease.
 
In short, expenses affect the NAV of the ETF, which in turn may or may not affect the price of the ETF. In efficient market times, NAV and price of the ETF should close to each other, so that's when expenses will be reflected in the price (i.e price of ETF reflects the true NAV of the fund).",,

If it is prior to expiration your only choices to exit are either sell the options if there is a bid, or exercise and take the shares. 
At expiration this doesn’t work like a standard gamma play because if option are in the money you’re just trading stock, if at the money they are basically binary options, and if out of the money they are nothing. 
If you (or a collective you) have enough capital you can move prices. This is neither surprising nor unusual. Trade execution and slippage has long been a major issue for large institutions and is the main motivation for the creation of dark pools. 
There is nothing magic about buying call options. To the extent there is a matched book you will meet selling interest. If your trade is big enough to exhaust selling interest you will start to move price and your synthetic leverage will manifest in the rebalancing of market makers as delta increases. For most traders this is undesirable as it increases your execution price. Not to mention it most likely drives bid ask spreads wider as you consume liquidity.

$A is committing some kinda of malpractice or fraud that I discovered.
$B is not, and I view it as having great growth prospects
I have a few different trades I can make here.
1. I can put all 50k in $B
2. I can short $A for 50k and do nothing with $B, I'd then have 100k cash.
3. I can short $A for 50k then take the new value of 100k and put that in $B since generally you don't need to hold cash as collateral for a short position.
Would you not say option 3 is the best for the economy and society since I essentially move value from $A to $B?
Now granted not everyone is into shorting for such altruistic reasons. You could simply think that in a pair of competitors one will do better than the other. E.g. $AMD is going to do better than $INTC, so you'd buy $AMD and short $INTC.
I think one thing people may forget or not realize is the money to get from short selling usually doesn't just sit there doing nothing; it usually gets put into another company since you don't need cash as collateral generally, owning stock in other companies is perfectly fine collateral.
I don't know exactly what you'd call ""explorative"" or ""mass market manipulation"", but the examples above are some of the most common reasons shorts are entered and wouldn't qualify as either imo.",,

I'd argue it's harder to manipulate a stock through shorting than it would be if you longed it. One simple reason lies in the asymmetrical mechanics of shorting (limited gain unlimited loss), but there's obviously other issues too.
I'd argue offering predatory high yield loans to a company is way less conducive to a healthy economy and way more effective in crippling a company. To extrapolate further, shorting a stock isn't going to put direct pressure on a company (since it's not going to affect the company's financial health), whereas high interest expenses will be DEFINITELY felt by a company. Granted often times these 2 are highly positively correlated.",,

No. That number, which you see on the balance sheet as paid-in capital, is the IPO offer price reported to the SEC & listed exchange BEFORE it actually trades (usually a day before). It's a one time thing. Before the first trading day starts, the shares will already NOT belong to the issuer. In sum, the issuer will already raised that amount (minus fees) from the underwriter. If the underwriter and the issuer can't agree on this number, IPO fails to go through.

THIS! This is what I was looking for. Thank you, kindly!

This point here is very key. While the underwriter won't change the price once it's declared, WHO the underwriter allocates shares to will be a factor. Hence, even if the shares are ""available"" to the public, it's often not really true because the underwriter will simply prefer to allocate the shares to it's own network of clients/institutional investors who they want to maintain a relationship with.

I think I understand. What you're saying is that the underwriter will likely make the money by drumming up interest from its own network of investors/clients (not through the public). It then turns that money over to the issuer. The public (in most cases) isn't really investing in the company directly (in the sense that my money when I buy stock doesn't go to the issuer). The company only ""raises"" money from: (a) the underwriter; or (b) maybe selling treasury shares?",,

Market makers do. There is some confusion because Citadel Securities is one of the largest market makers in public equities and Citadel Investment Group is one of the largest investors in the hedge fund space, but they are different entities.
Market makers will pay for certain types of order flow, specifically retail flow from brokers like Robhinhood, Schwab, Ameritrade, etc because it tends to be a lot of small, uncorrelated orders. The market maker earns a bid/offer spread every time they round trip buy/sell. But they take some risk if they end up with a directional position and the price moves before they complete the other side. Big institutions tend to move prices with their orders and/or have some informational advantage whereas retail trades usually have neither of these risk. So if market makers can fill a lot of retail orders they get a very low risk way to earn the bid offer, to the extent that they can even share some of the profits via payment for this order flow (and also offer better execution at the same time.)",,

My fees are taken out of the NAV. Where is that money, for the fees, actually being taken away from me? Like how am I paying for those fees? They never show up on your account statement so that’s why I’m confused. Most people have told me that it just comes out of the price of the ETF overtime.",,

If you're buying a $100k house, you might have $1k earnest money due at the time of the contract signing, and probably $3k - $4k in closing costs, taxes, and insurance. Let's just call it $4k for sake of hypotheticals. 
Your total money out of pocket is your $3k down payment and $4k closing costs, taxes, and insurance or $7k total. 
You'll pay $1k in earnest money up front. You'll probably pay another ~$500 to the mortgage company to order an appraisal. So you'll have prepaid $1,500 of your $7k and you'll need to bring a check for $5,500 to closing.

Like how am I paying for those fees?

 
You are indirectly paying for it. Bank account example again. Each day the fund's bank account is reduced by that fee (NAV reduced by expenses). Again, the PRICE of the ETF on the market may or may not be the same as the NAV (what's called premium or discount to NAV).
 
If you ever were bored enough to look through an ETF prospectus, they'll disclose daily fees in there.",,

For example in 1 month I was able to make from $1 000 ->>> $30 000 but I had big problem with risk control so I was keep losing all money again and again. Later I learn at least not losing my invested amount… Then I quit trading and moved to telecommunications business. I was generating huge income in telecommunications but my partners created scam scheme and scammed me on $900k and I didn’t have any choose so decide to close everything..
After that something changed in my mind and I understand that my biggest problem in my life is risk control… I’m able to generate huge income but not able to control this assets.. SO I learn money management and return back to Forex.
At moment I’m trading currency every day. I close in average 10–20 trades daily(all in profit). Not losing capital and growing every day. In average I make 10% per month without risk of losing my capital. As well I have created own affiliate web store what bring passive income. As I always need to do something.. trading become boring :) but it’s super profitable.

Bitcoin suffers from none of that, and just on one or two of the problems it solves, on those alone it is on its way to at least a 10T market cap, as it is better than gold is at being gold, more divisible, more verifiable, but most importantly decentralized and super cheap to transport across the world. But then you look over to negative interest reates and the size of that market currently (20T), plus many others, real estate, fine art, and other store of values, and you see such a massive addressable market. There is nothing as undervalued out there right now (even with a 5x increase in 6 months) than Bitcoin, with the lowest risk possible.

Lol. The stocks fell because people cashed out. The stock was always going to fall. No offense but you seem like a novice here.

Just like how shorters can get squeezed by buying in and inflating the price even higher, those who sell in high quantities can drag the price lower. You're debating semantics at this point. It 100% is deception whether you realize it or not. Saying people should have been aware of the risk doesn't excuse that. That community went from 500k users to 8.5 million within a couple of weeks. The reason the squeeze was even allowed to happen was because there weren't many shares to be sold in the market once Reddit pushed a mass buying and other institutions who held GME decided to hold. So no, it wasn't just one or two retail traders. It was Reddit starting a momentum that ended up deceiving thousands of people. A large percentage of Americans purchased a meme stock during this cycle. Do you honestly think the people who figured out about the over shorting by hedge funds really cared about sticking it to the hedge funds? And yet, that was all we heard 90% of the time.

The buying restriction for retail investors timed right with the stock beginning to fall from what I saw. That's manipulation. There were no restrictions on institutional investors. Large investors that were already in Gamestop and not part of Reddit or the hype also cashed out, but I mean the average people. Your average person didn't have high quantities to create that much volatility.
If you were told that Gamestop is rising fast and you bought some, there's no deception. If you were told that small investors are affecting  hedge funds by buying in, there's no deception. Deception is lying. Where's the lie? If you bought Gamestop based on Reddit or the headlines and lost your investment, would you say that you didn't know that could happen? Plus the trading restriction was on buying, not selling. Pulling your money out was always an option from what I saw. Continuing to assume risk is your choice.
Being aware of the risk is part of the disclaimer that trading platforms use. Once you give the warning, the user is on their own. The increase in Reddit users speaks to what I was saying. It wasn't millions of people putting in every dollar they have. There were a lot of people putting in small amounts, and some big players that have been holding for years. Combined they created volatility. I haven't heard anyone say that this was fraudulent though. Pumping stock is done in the media every day and people make their buying decisions based on it. Is that deception?",,

This is why you mainly saw free brokerages like RobinHood or WeBull halt their trading. Many individuals were purchasing GME on margin accounts and the collateral was increased because if the stock prices tank, RobinHood would be held liable to make up the deficit. It gets complicated explaining it but most retail traders signing up for RobinHood or any brokerage don't understand how trades are processed. A brokerage is mainly a middleman. The reason institutions could still buy or sell is precisely because these institutions aren't using RobinHood. RobinHood provides no benefit to institutional investors. Not every brokerage halted trading but the reason RobinHood was the biggest name mentioned is because RobinHood is the most popular free trading brokerage for new and retail investors. 
The average person might not but you need to ask yourself why was Reddit being mentioned if this had very little to do with the average person? It's because regardless of how you may choose to believe it, GameStop didn't have much open float in the market and a huge band of Reddit individuals + institutional investors who didn't sell made it possible. The simple fact that the community grew from 500k to 8.5 million users within two weeks should tell you just how much market power Reddit had in terms of GME. Let's just say on average that 10% of the subreddit had purchased GME with an average # of shares at 10. That's 8.5 million shares. And that's me being generous with the average # of shares. Some may have owned 1 when they purchased it at $200-$300 but there were a ton of people who purchased upwards of thousands of shares at $30-$50. That's 8.5 million shares. There are a total of 47 million share float. If you add in the institutional investors, then there simply wasn't enough shares which is why the price skyrocketed. High demand, low supply. Someone was buying them and the trend started on Reddit. It doesn't take a genius to see that there was more than enough market power than you're estimating. 
Look, I'm not going to in-depth about the meaning of deception. People are dumb and couldn't resist the gains that were plastered all over the media because of a supposed war vs hedge funds. That's where the deception started. You're simply stating that there is a risk to investing. Sure, no one disputes that. These people who lost money have zero case to retrieve their losses. The point is, they were deceived by others in some shape or form mainly to continue holding as it would continue 'skyrocketing' and when the individuals who had enough shares began unloading to take profit, it went downhill and there was no more 'HOLD HOLD HOLD.' 
Once again, I'm not disputing the risk. My point is these individuals were being misled the entire time. You have to be SERIOUSLY misled to purchase GME at $300 because no one in their right mind would consider that an investment. Debating semantics isn't really helping anyone here. 
Yeah, the media deceives individuals every day. What's your point? Deception isn't illegal. People are entitled to their opinions. It still doesn't change the fact that people were deceived at the end of the day which is why many have suffered losses while the very few have gained significantly. Anyways, I'm not really interested in dragging this along. It was a deliberate scam since the beginning masqueraded as a war vs hedge funds because that was the only way people were going to be supportive of pushing GME. Like I've already stated, the early people knew GME was going to tank eventually. They never once mentioned it because if they did, it would have never climbed the way it did.",,

It seems to me that Robinhood would have prevented both buying and selling if they were worried about the stock tanking. A massive sell-off from Robinhood users would create more volatility.
I learned about this through Reddit, and the message that the stock could/would tank was everywhere. Small investors that joined the hype knew they were putting in money that they could lose. I didn't see anyone that was surprised about the risk. I just don't see where there was a scam. No one went into this with no idea what could happen.
I think Reddit was all over the media because it's a good story. It's a small corner of the internet that was originally full of people with plenty of money to invest who did their research. It grew because of the media, but that's after GME had been a topic there for a long time. I don't think one group on Reddit is capable of causing wild swings in the market when billions are being lost or gained by institutional investors. Hedge funds can affect the market though, and Reddit was able to affect them. That was the problem. It was the retail investors having influence on them that needed to be stopped. If retail investors had lost out while the hedge funds made billions, I don't think it would have been a story or seen as an issue.",,
