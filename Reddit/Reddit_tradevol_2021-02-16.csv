Mainly watching what happens with SPX before I make my next serious move:

SPX close above 3965 on any day (esp. Friday) and I'm all in /ES to catch the euphoria rip
SPX close between 3870-3920 on Friday and I'll just spend the rest of my life BTFD bc nothing matters but the Fed

This.  >3965 is too far above the monthly trend (esp. since November) that options sellers should have to do significant re-hedging to deal with it.  They're already apparently having a bad month -- weekly vol has been consistently mispriced.

still wondering whether, given quad witching and the volumes of expiries involved, we might expect MMs to primarily hedge *into* this Friday’s close to protect against 2/19 ITM quad call expiries (understand from elsewhere that much quad witching-related price action happens in the days prior to the expiry). this would mean loading up on shares for offloading into close 2/19 or even before would be the move.
Or whether we can expect MMs to *continue* delta hedging into Monday / next week, based on subsequent expiries, because a >3965 Friday close means they won’t have been able to sufficiently hedge by EOD Friday 2/19 what they will need to have hedged by 2/26? Could it be both?
Presumably it depends on how much pile on there is into calls for both 2/19 and 2/26 expiries between now and this Friday, and how much hedging happens in between?",,

If you want to hedge against forward variations in Vol going long OTM VIX calls is not going to serve that purpose. As counterintuitive as it sounds it will do the opposite. It is important to distinguish between the VIX cash or index and the VROs VIX options and VX VIX futures. I think you would be better off  reading the spec sheets provided by the CBOE, but long story short VIX futures capture 60 to 70 % ( at optimal conditions)  of the variations in the index  and the options track the futures ( again read the spec sheet and look for the SOQ). The ETPs are usually a combination of different term VX futures ( that adds more roll yield considerations) and I would suggest reading the specific spec sheet for each ETP. As an example  the VXX is a combination of current and coming maturity futures. The weighting of each future in the ETP is variable and in function of each passing day to compensate for the roll yield. I hope this helps this isn't a straightforward trading endeavor but it'll be good for you.

Basically if market is decently long and gamma rolling off, you end up getting less local support to keep price moves in check so on balance a small move lower could turn into something bigger.
Even if stuff is rolled, the local gamma might be lower (e.g. 3800 and 3850 work as pins with positive gamma for now, rolled out gamma might be higher strike and lower absolute value around here)",,

Holding 10k $UVXY average price $23,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradeVol/comments/kw5vya/series_of_bad_decisions_holding_10k_uvxy_average/gj3tf0r/,,reddit,"I would second the idea of selling covered calls. Some data to think about first:

UVXY is an ETF following 1.5x leveraged SPVXSP, which in turn is a weighted index of 1st and 2nd month vix futures
The SPVXSP index is meant to represent 1m constant maturity forward (CMF) of the vix index which is at 24.9 as of yesterday's close (1m fut * 1m weight + 2m fut * 2m weight)
Looking at the timeseries of 1m CMF on vix over 13y (incl '08), we're at the ~75th percentile with min at 11.4 and max at 70.5 (max reached last year)
Intraday max was probably higher, but for arguments sake let's assume that max on the index
UVXY closed at 10.66 yesterday
Hence, even if we went to that max tomorrow, your upside is probably capped somewhere around there, i.e. 70.5 / 24.9 * 1.5 * 10.66 = 45.2. Meaning that if the vix futures trades where they have at their most distressed last year, UVXY would trade at 45, not 110 --> rolldown and leveraging magic...
The reason we went from around this level to 110 in feb/mar-20 was two things, (1) because the 1m constant maturity forward was around 15 and went to 70.5, i.e. 70.5 / 15 * 1.5 * 11 = 77.5 and (2) the fact that the futures curve inverted (1m expiry futures more valuable than 2m --> roll up with leverage) 
So assuming that you're not of the view that we will have an even bigger market event in the coming months than last year, you're upside is probably capped at around 45 (+/- any curve inversion).
My view is that something like UVXY should trade around 6-7$ by June

So in terms of what to do:

You're in a tough spot, if the remaining value of the position is a lot of money for you (e.g. money you can't really afford to lose), it's probably best to just cut it and move on.
If you can and want to spend a lot of time and energy to try and recover, I think covered calls are the thing to trade around this. For example:


Selling 23 strike jun21 exp calls are trading at around $2.90 mid (iVol at 190%) and are around 50% delta, so if you sell those, you will mitigate around half the damage of any move lower and collect around 27% of your current exposure (2.9 / 10.66 = 27%) by june. You will also benefit from an iVol move lower which should happen if vix moves into a lower range. The issue here is that as and when the 1m CMF collapses back to a more 'normal' level like the 50th percentile,  ~19 and if the curve continues to be steep vix < 1m future < 2m future, you will be in pain and by the time june comes and you want to roll out your 23 strike call, you'll prob get a lot less for it. If at that point you're willing to take some extra risk, you can roll the strike down too, e.g. to 20 or 18 strike, you might be able to recoup more. Hence, an alternative:
Selling 23 strike jan23 expiry calls around mid at 6.70 (ivol ~155%), delta of 76%. It's a touch better from a final recovery perspective and you need to worry less about rolling the call out. But be warned, you are likely going to lock in your loss, you will be married to the position and have limited upside. Wouldn't be my preference, but you get rid of more of the outright risk and reduce the roll risk. It's also pretty illiquid...
Finally, if you have extra cash to put against this as collateral, you could consider selling double the notional on 23 strike jun21, i.e. 200 contracts. Gives much better economics (delta flat between your outright and the option and you collect 50% of you existion notional), but big big health warning, you can lose a lot more if you do that and probably need to buy more UVXY if the market pukes again. If you were in a fund or bank, might be a trade they would do, but not something for the faint hearted or the undercapitalised...
In any case, for any of the covered call trades, make sure to work a limit order, market order will kill you there.


Obviously all of this is not formal advice or anything, def need to do your homework on this before adding calls into the mix.
Edit: thanks for the gold! Good luck!",,

Can you elaborate on why you think $UVXY will be $6-7 by June?
I’m short and have been since in size for a few months given how overwhelmingly positive economic data continues to be, how easy the runway for growth is this year given easy comparisons, and visibility to continued stimulus if anything went wrong.
It’s been a great ride but I’m still amazed VIX is >20. It’s unprecedented in the QE era for a macro environment this strong. 
It seems a lot of the vol premium is being driven by calls with put / call ratio near lows, so maybe vol just stays higher for a period with all the retail speculation, but VIX has always decayed down to a low teens number in very strong cyclical environments. The market becomes comfortable with the earnings outlook and vol get depressed.
That’s still my view which is why I’m short. Risk reward seems fantastic. Interested to hear more on why you think we get below $7 by summer.

Holding 10k $UVXY average price $23,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradeVol/comments/kw5vya/series_of_bad_decisions_holding_10k_uvxy_average/gj852zs/,,reddit,"So I keep wondering myself why ppl still pile into SPX options here and keep bidding both vix and vix futs and I think there's a million reasons to rationalise it (e.g. 'upside call buying', 'weaponised gamma from wsb', 'real-money managers have made so much money and are nervously hedging downside for every tick higher in stocks here' etc.).
Ultimately though, if you check since the election: most spot implied vol indices have been grinding higher (vix, move) and even though realised vol has been coming down (30d spx realised vol 22-ish around the election to 10 now), that picture isn't actually complete. If you use something like Wilders ATR (https://www.quantshare.com/sa-527-using-average-true-range-to-measure-intraday-volatility) and then do the timeseries of intraday realised volatility of the max of the three component returns, your 30d realised is actually more like 22.5, bang on where vix is trading, rather than the 30d close-to-close realised vol of 10).
So my guess is actually vol is not that 'expensive' here if you include intraday moves which you have no reason not to capture (if you own options, you can delta hedge and make money on higher realised vs implied vol and SPX futures are open almost all day).
To answer the question though:
There's 2 ways UVXY or similar can go lower: (1) the 1m CMF goes lower i.e. vix <20, vix futs <25 and (2) the vix vs 1m CMF realises the roll yield, i.e. vix stays consistently in a lower range than where 1m and 2m futures are trading over the next few months.
In my view, unless intraday realised vol comes down too, we won't see vix leading the charge lower, hence my assumption is (conservatively) that vix stays in a 20-30 range for the next few months, but UVXY will move lower because of the roll yield realising, eg. assume that vix stays in the lower end of the range from today til end of jun with 1m CMF 6% higher on average and 1m < 2m, then you can back of the envelope, assume UVXY in jun = (1 - 0.06 * 1.5)^5.5 * 10.2 = 6.1.
But tbh man, short UVXY outright in size here, balls of steel... I hope you have the $$ for the margin if we blow up. Also think about risk-reward, you're potentially making 30-40% in 6 months risking a pretty chunky loss. Could be more of course if we fully normalise, but who knows when that'll happen...
Edit: maths on the UVXY roll yield calc - forgot the leverage",,

Hadn’t seen the intraday methodology before. That makes sense... guess I’m still shocked how much intraday vol there is! 
We have all the data points that matter: the business cycle is getting better (look at PMI, commodity pricing, every leading indicator is en fuego, and comps actually only get easier) and we haven’t even gotten the new stimulus yet. 
On the rates side, the Fed is saying they want to create an asset bubble. They want inflation to be >2% and are keeping rates pinned at zero until we get there. Anything goes wrong they’ll just print more.
What are people so anxious about? I don’t really get it. DJT’s departure is a total cluster but it shouldn’t matter for corporate profits.
Level of vol is really unprecedented for how strong fundamentals are. I just think everyone is anchoring to how bad the world was a year ago and we normalize in terms of VIX levels shortly after Trump moves to Boca and isn’t on the news anymore. Also check out Cuomo’s most recent presentation on opening NYC: now that we have a unified party in charge, Covid is going to become a more solvable problem. He wants the city open ASAP. And scaled vaccines not far away. 
Institutions will start shorting vol again and that could put pressure on realized. 
And when I say “in size” I mean like a 7% position paired with a long equity portfolio that obviously will be positively correlated with short vol. I am prepared for these things to go up 3x. But expected value is so good here over a year idk how you can’t be short... at whatever size you think is appropriate to ride out.
Also harder to get totally destroyed when starting point for vol is well above 20. I don’t short vol ever below 15 but >20 when world is clearly getting better... you only get a change to do this every 3-4 years. 
Edit: adding commentary on Cuomo reopening and VIX levels. The last comment",,

Fortunately have been sized in a way to ride out volatility but I mean I could not have gotten that initial move any more incorrect.
MS vol strategists are arguing today retail is back in size on long vol trade and overwhelming institutional short vol capacity, making the market less stable. Maybe the case... who knows. 
I still think we trend lower on realized and implied given the macro environment. Expected value on the trade is high but you can’t size it too bug given convexity.
Could I ask you to clarify how you calculate the roll yield? I’ve been trying to research it and see so many different answers. 
Like the 6% you cited above, what’s the relationship there? Is that CMF vs spot VIX? Or is that the monthly slide based on M2 to M1?

Yeah, I don't disagree and tbh, a lot of what you mention is in my base case too. I'm bullish for this year, even if that might not have come accross! (VIX < 20 and will stay below there, SPX hits 4500). You've prob listed all the reasons there. The only thing in the short-term is that the market is still somewhat coming to grips with this whole MMT experiment. 
We will just end up with an asset price bubble like you say, but I also think it might put some vol into US rates as investors look hard at the increasing debt, in turn prompting the FED to put in place YCC (US Treasury auction today and 10y yield +4bps, that's a 1.5sigma move on a 10y horizon). And in my mind until the market has found that new normal in rates, rates vol will be a thing and in a way can be the mother of all vol given the amount of assets and relative pricing it influences. 
So I am with you, but I just think it will take some more time for markets to really accept the new environment and probably for the Fed to really step up the YCC game before implied vols come lower across assets.

Sure enough, the VIX futures camp was correct, as the market didn't care who won (I really doubt the market crashed if Trump won), rallied 8% this week and now we see the VIX at 25, a 40% drop in one week.  Those SPX options OTM puts buyers lost bigly through overpaid premium.

Couple issues with the paper, I think that using standard deviation in this context isn't the right tool. Volatility trading tends to follow log normal distribution instead of standard, so computing around a mean is misleading. Or rather, the mean itself is misleading.

Regarding mean reversion, even with the mean-reverting properties of the VIX, a tradable strategy can be difficult because equities and volatility ETPs are not necessarily mean reverting (even when the VIX does mean revert).

I don't have a twitter account, so I can't comment on the specifics. However,  my general comment would be that using dealer positioning is very tricky cause you never know what's going for sure. First, you don't know which way the flows were. Second, even if you are really good at  assigning flows, there is a vast world of OTC that includes some large exposures.

However.
This was price action of ETN shares vs the NAV; this was *not* the cause of Volpocalypse.  The crux of Volpocalypse was on the VIX futures side, where weighted mixture of M1 and M2 got elevated 96% vs previous day.

The article got some things right and some things wrong. I was involved on the arb trade heavily at the time, though it's all pretty hazy to me by now (plus, I am high as a kite right now so forgive me).
IIRC, it was a perfect storm made out of smaller events. I think XIV was suddenly trading at a discount after trading at a large premium for a while so a bunch of ETP arbs wanted to cover that on TAS. Also, market is was a bit down but VIX futures weren't up too much so there was some bid from vol buyers. In total, it was just enough for a medium-size rebalance (the index was up like a 25-30% by the close), but total NAV was pretty high. So suddenly we were looking at a TAS volume that was meaningfully higher than the ADV so TAS futures went up from the usual 1/-1 to positive 5/6 (eventually going to mid-teens) and futures went up.  SVXY managers blinked and covered in continuous market, which spiked it further and there you go.
In short, the leveraged ETPs just gotten too big. With 3+ billion on Friday, just the inverses had about 230-240k futures, so even a 20% rebalance on TAS was a meaningful fraction of ADV and everyone would expect it to spike the settlement. Hell, even without front-running by the likes of myself, if you assume ~20% of daily volume trading on settlement, we are talking a 100% volume participation. The theoretical timing of the print (at 4pm or 4:15pm) would have bee irrelevant, market impact is impact.",,

Also, market is was a bit down but VIX futures weren't up too much so there was some bid from vol buyers.  
In total, it was just enough for a medium-size rebalance (the index was up like a 25-30% by the close), but total NAV was pretty high.

My understanding is that, because XIV tracked a rolling mixture of M1 and M2, if VIX futures weren't up too much then NAV (or Indicative Value - I'm using the terms interchangeably here) also couldn't have been drastically low between 3 pm ~ 4 pm.
This is before we consider the size of AUM or the impact of rebalancing (which typically happens between 4 - 4:15), just purely speaking in terms of how the instrument was designed to track.
EDIT: I agree that the size of ETPs got too big; although I think the timing of rebalancing is also a factor, because 240k futures contracts all rushing to rebalance at the same time vs spread out during the day makes a big difference.

As of Friday’s market close, we have VXX price of $25.54, and /VX futures of (in order of date) 31.23, 32.93, 31.05, and 30.05.
Your put spread legs are 6% and 37% OTM, respectively. Your call spread legs are 115% and 233% OTM, respectively.
In order to hit a $55 handle VXX, we’re going to need those futures to be in about the 60-65 range in the next two months. That is a very big ask. A VIX spot at 60 is not going to cut it either. To get the futures to the 60’s, you’ll need a spot at least 70+ realistically. That is because VXX has a rolling basket of futures, so even if you nail a (lets say for example) 65 spot VIX price on the day before expiration on the Oct future, that future will only be worth about 3% of VXX’s total value as it will have mostly rolled over to Nov’s futures contracts at that point. Given that this is an election, a known unknown, even if your expected reactions from the various political parties is correct, unless the losing side literally launches a coup, I don’t see this trade as having a real chance at hitting ITM. A VIX that high really needs an unknown unknown to hit the market, and hit hard at that. We’ll need to see selling at the same level or worse than that of the March crash. That means circuit breaker hits every day and a general market decline of at least 35%. 
That being said, this could still work if you have an exit strategy that does not require an ITM scenario. If you were targeting exiting this trade if VXX hits $40 or so at a time window ahead of expiration, then you have a chance at winning this trade. I do not think your thesis supports a trade with this low of probability of going ITM, but it is possible I’m wrong. Also a completely unrelated black swan event could possibly get us there but that would be blind luck as most of us cannot predict those.",,

This is a difficult trade but it can work.  Overall I lost money on it, but it is possible to make money, under current market conditions, with careful entry points.  If you could safely do it with a large position and let it ride you could get rich, and that’s what got me into it...   but you can’t really do that.
I know an embarrassing amount about this trade, and did a lot of manual backtesting as well as writing a little code.
I found that 90-120 DTE options work well, and closer to expiration than 60 days is super stressful.  For options that far out, offsetting the strike price low generally helps if you want to make money on both up and down moves.   This is because IV on index ETF’s is strongly inversely correlated with price movement, so you need the call side of the straddle a little in the money to offset IV crush on underlying gains.  Under most conditions 1 to 1.5% low is a good number (eg $3 below ATM on QQQ).   It can vary according to what IV is doing.   You can buy ATM if you have a slightly bearish bias but in that case you will usually be negative on price movement up, and should roll to a new higher strike price if/when you can do so without realizing a loss.
Sometimes IV will do weird things and you will be down despite significant realized volatility that would have normally paid a few percent.   Trust me, this is extremely frustrating.   This is especially true in situations following periods when the VIX is rising while SPY rises, which happened a good bit about a month ago. 
Also VIX, VXQ, etc are based on near term option prices.   3 month options don’t always play the way VIX says they should.
For me it was a gut-wrenching trade compared to, say, writing options and credit spreads on VIX ETF’s and reasonably safe equities.
I was doing the straddles with too large of a position size, six figures when I am not really wealthy, and watching theta and vega decay on that kind of position while you wait for price movement is nerve racking. Meanwhile at a small position size it doesn’t really pay that well for the super-active management required.
The problem is that there is no good exit point.   I exited a couple of trades 5-10% down that would have eventually paid.  But sooner or later there will come a time when VIX crashes while the market goes sideways, and you will watch your position go well under 50%, so you just can’t watch it go down indefinitely.   Even when it’s working you often have to stomach 2-3% position drawdowns to make 1%, or 5-10% drawdowns to make a few percent.",,

Writing a single leg option contract is effectively a limit order that you get paid for.  It’s a short vol trade and thus hopefully not off topic.   
I have only sold call credit spreads on UVXY, which is an especially short vol trade.   UVXY decays enough that 80-85% of weeks it will close lower or on a tiny green doji.   You can fill near the money $1 spreads for $0.25 which should be profitable in the long run.   See my recent post history from r/thetagang.
Don’t do long vol trades on UVXY or VXX, they decay too fast, just buy VIX ETN calls or SPY/QQQ puts instead.
For equities and ETF’s I just sell puts until assigned, then sell calls until exercised, which is called “running the wheel”.    I often buy to close if I’m up a lot quickly on something choppy.  I also do this on VXX, but not UVXY, it decays faster than you can reliably make premiums.  I sell weekly calls on VXX once assigned and hold it unencumbered over weekends as a hedge.
Sell puts on things you think are safe or things you want to own anyway, and try to avoid getting greedy just for high premiums.   I shoot for 1% a week on nominal value in the current market, which is still a little greedy and risky.   Right now it is typically what you can get near-the-money for short dated options on moderate-risk tickers.",,

As a back story I started messing with vol at the time of the XIV debacle. I had been watching the short vol ETFs and was waiting for a pullback to jump in (had no understanding of Jack - read the PSA at the top of this sub). I ended up catching a falling knife and losing about 40 percent on buying SVXY after hours the night of the volpocalypse. 
Then I started learning how this stuff works and found him among a few others. Since then thru the first of this year I had pretty much made back what I lost and covered the subscription cost. I have had a couple of bonehead trades where I didn’t get out despite signals and then kept holding on. 
All in all it has been a learning experience and 2 1/2 years later I’m about break even and have lessons learned. 
I keep following Brent and the xivinvestment signals as a gut check and insurance policy to hopefully get out before the next black swan event. I’m a little suspicious as to whether any signal really did anything other than get lucky when all that went down.",,

I trade brents tactical strategies straight up and pick and choose a handful of his options ones. The options have not been real good to me in total but I haven’t had a steady allocation on every one of them. 
I also use his tactical signals along with the signals from XIVInvestment and my own to trade some verticals on VXX and TQQQ. With those I am rolling every month and trying to put half the gains back into the investment and put half in my regular portfolio. At this point my original cost basis has been recovered and it’s house money. This is in the last 2 months so not a lot of history but I can’t lose more than I have made.

Every point in VX is 1,000.  For instance if you short /VX (Front month) at 25.50 and it goes to 26 - hardly a big move - you're out $500.  Margin requirements can be $20k+.  They are also inexplicably 10x the size of VIX options, even though VIX options trade on the underlying VX.  This means that if you want to start shorting September VX future but limit your losses by buying VIX September calls, you'd need to short one VX future but also buy TEN VIX September calls.  The minimum tick size is also $0.05, which means EVERY move is a $50 swing, and crossing the spread is expensive. 
These new futures have a smaller notional size. Every point in VX is $100, their margin requirements are 1/10 of /VX, and they track 1:1 with VIX options now as well. 
Previously, you probably needed a vol trading allocation of six figures to safely trade /VX. Not a six figure total portfolio, I mean literally just the part dedicated to trading this one instrument due to the notional size. That's a tall order for many.  This change makes it much more accessible.

Regular VX contracts aren’t even all that big anyway. It’s basically 40x as expensive as an ES contract to cross the spread for similar notional.
Edit: 40x assumes 1 $160k ES contract (today's value) equivalent 10 $16k vx (VIX @ 16).  That's $500 to cross the spread w/the VIX futures vs $12.50 for ES.  Fucking dumb on CBOE's part.",,

We are so spoiled in 2020 with how low comms and spreads are compared to 20 or even 10 or 5 years ago. Total cost to trade is super low, all things considered. 
Bringing more people to the market (with stuff like reasonably size VX futures) might actually get us to a point where the spreads can be tightened. 
I disagree with your comparison to ES. The notional $ amount is quite different from their vol, so that's not a reasonable comparison.  With VX currently at 25.55, you're be looking at ~7x VX futures to get to a notional $ amount with /ES.  But the margin requirements on those VX futures would be $313k vs $13k for /ES.  And obviously the vol of 7 VX futures contracts is WAY more than a single /ES.  
If you go by margin reqs, it'll be ~6x /VXM to equal the margin req of 1x /ES.  That's $30 vs $12.50.  Yes, I wish they were tighter, but that's not absurd.",,

But it's not that easy. It's never that easy. Your only option for long vol is something that will lose more and more value the longer we go without a volatility event, to the point where you could have the biggest VIX spike on record and still not break even. Just imagine if you bought VXX in early 2017. Not even a combination of Volpocalypse, Q4 2018 and literally the biggest VIX spike on record would have saved you there and that was only 3 years ago.
Where there is a really good chance that the VIX will rise to a certain level from another lower level, the same can't be said for VXX or any investable vol products.
Longer-dated options are probably a better bet, but they will require more active management, something you were looking to avoid. They also come with their own caveats too.",,

I'm experimenting with a strategy that involves buying a far-dated straddle and selling a short-dated strangle (very wide, e.g. 5-10 delta). The goal is to have positive gamma. The short strangle reduces the cost of the position and also the negative theta. Right now it's working out nicely, but to be honest I don't have a good mental model of it because I find different option expirations on VIX complicated to reason about.

You may be ok if it moves to a negative delta (e.g. short VIX) if you're using this as a trading strategy, but you definitely shouldn't be ok with it if this is intended to be a long volatility hedge.

I intend to use it as a trading strategy, correct. A bit of context: the original idea was to apply this strategy to stock underlyings or ETFs (e.g. SPY/IWM). I wanted to do gamma scalping without touching the underlying, so:
1) open a gamma positive, delta-neutral spread like I describe above at a support/resistance point;
2) sell at another extreme;
3) start over with a new delta-neutral spread.
Of course, that's easier said than done. It worked out perfectly at the beginning of June, but in the last two weeks this strategy performed really bad. I applied it to IWM and since it got stuck in the same tight range I just lost a ton on volatility dropping. Part of that was due to a really bad entry: a long-gamma, long-vega strategy like this should not be opened when IV is so high.
That got me thinking: if this strategy does so well when vol rises, I should only open it when vol is already high if I hedge on volatility dropping. So I opened a similar long straddle/short strangle on VIX. That one was not delta-neutral but had negative delta at the beginning, to offset the vega exposure of the IWM one.
Now I'm seeing that the VIX spread is doing much better than the IWM one, and I am thinking of using it as an actual trading strategy. If I do that, I will start delta-neutral like the original plan was.
I just need to understand completely how VIX options at different expirations are affected by the term structure. I also need to understand which one between contango and backwardation is the ideal environment for a short strangle/long straddle strategy like this one. Without too much thinking, I would say that backwardation is much better.",,

I researched what long vol instruments are good for hedging. The conclusion is the Midterm VIX 4-7 month futures ETN VXZ performs best vs VXX. The asset is used for simple hedging, if they tried timing the market they can make more. I'm also seeing VXZ capture a nice upside with much slower decay coming back down so you have a chance to retain some of the profit without a perfect signal. It's worth backtesting IMHO.

1. With an expiry 1-3 weeks out, using spreads is a very good idea to mitigate the theta decay that'll be increasing every day as the expiration draws closer. The biggest problem with this strategy though is its inflexibility if UVXY moves against you in this trade. Volatility tends to move very fast to the upside, and so is a non-negligible tail risk every time your spread gets close to expiring that there will be a vol spike and your spread that was worth 99c of its $1 max will suddenly go OTM on the last day. UVXY in particular can be difficult to maneuver in this circumstance since the bid/ask spreads on each option leg can get large in times of panic. To jump the bid/ask spread can be very expensive.
2. As your post actually pointed out, UVXY and VXX puts are priced skewed to the downside, which during times of high contango can get extreme and really eat into your profits. For example, if random company ABC is trading at $20, a $21/20 call debit spread and a $19/20 put debit spread should both cost $0.50, because there is a 50/50 chance that the stock will go up or down from today’s price. But this pricing can get skewed if there is high demand for one side and low demand for the other. During the super low vol years of 2016-2017, ATM debit spreads could be as high as $0.70 for put spreads and $0.30 for call spreads. This just reflected the market as seeing the odds of UVXY/VXX going down during the option time period as 70%. Unfortunately there’s not really any way to avoid this, other than pursuing an option strategy outside of a same-date debit or credit spread. 
This strategy is certainly viable and very profitable as longs as you’re on the right side of the trade, even with skewed pricing, but just wanted to share some of my experience on it.",,

I have one question, on the technical side: how do you make your order go through?

I suppose it would be a little riskier if I shorted at this very moment, but if I wait for another spike on the VIX in the coming weeks ( ~60 doesn't seem so out of question), seems like the upside outweighs the downside.

I do have a bad tendency to underestimate risk on my plays... I guess I was assuming the odds of TVIX spiking back up to $400-500 over the coming weeks is at least decently high. I would short it then and ride it out until it draws back to $100 or so.
Worst case, TVIX double tops (like vol did in '08), and it spikes back up to $1000, in which case I'd be at -100% (as opposed to -2500%) and would just cover my position until volatility inevitably draws down again. But even a double top seems pretty unlikely at this point, no? Seems like a slow bleed for the market from here on out is more likely than a crash like the one we had Feb-Mar. I can't imagine the kind of news we'd need for another similarly violent crash and VIX to spike back up to 80-90.
I wouldn't dare short sell TVIX under regular market circumstances/a more mild correction, but with TVIX as extended as it is, that's what led me to think it's more of a no-brainer trade I suppose? I will definitely look more into DITM puts though. Thanks for the help.",,

If I buy OTM puts on VXX, will I lose money when volatility decreases? 

Yes, when VVIX decreases (which usually tracks with VIX).

Is it better to buy one of the inverse VIX products than to use options?

In the current volatility environment, I'd generally say yes for the average person.  Typically shorting VXX is the superior option to owning SVXY, though.

For example, buying the 1mo 10% OTM put vs 10% OTM call. Without knowing how your signal works exactly, I looked at the returns of this for roughly when you would put it on and it seems to improve the returns quite a bit. You don't miss out as often when things go sideways or rally small and you have greater protection when the market bottoms out. You could also do a put spread vs call (5% otm/35% otm put spread vs 15-20% otm call) for roughly flat premium. You don't get the full downside protection, but it gives you a substantial amount and you don't miss out if it turns out to be nothing.  
Right now, what you are doing is delevering your portfolio when the signal indicates to be in cash, which is a one idea for managing the risk (and a great one in many respects), but you may get a closer to what you want through this.
​
Would be curious to hear what you think. The other thing is that you will have fewer taxable events in this case. If it turns out to be nothing, you will realize a loss or nothing on the options when you exit the position and you will not have sold out of your TQQQ (or whatever). If it turns out to be something, your sell price will be marginally lower than if you simply sold out of it.",,

A risk reversal is extremely cheap and easy to execute for the purpose I proposed. The goal isn't to prevent any decline, it is simply to prevent blow out risk without getting out of all the shares and necessitating a capital gain/loss. It functionally has the same effect.
I don't have the model for his signal, so I can't do any backtest on it. If you eyeball it, the performance would probably be fairly similar. It would get out slightly later in a couple instances by whatever % OTM put you purchased and would have made more money in most cases because it went sideways and/or rallied small. In at least two instances, you avoided ST capital gain and moved it into a LT capital gain, which is a huge benefit. When things are calm, a 50% otm put on something like TQQQ is extremely cheap and would be a very easy way to prevent a liquidation event.

Another potential thing you could do to juice your returns, which eyeballing works really well is to overlay your long with call 1x2s that are flat premium. Ex buying 1x the 10-15% otm call vs selling 2x 25-35% otm call roughly 30-60d out. Depending on the vol and expiry chosen, this can usually be done for roughly flat premium because it benefits from the way TQQQ is priced, so the upside calls actually have skew (higher implied vol) in them.

thesis: volatility will decrease as in smaller % moves in the index going forward
thought process following thesis:
- this means short volatility is a good move
- puts are too expensive and my thesis is volatility should decrease, so if i am right they would get vol crushed
- SVXY should increase as volatility decreases without risking vol crush with options. 
- thus holding SVXY is a good move to profit from lowering volatility

Is there any evidence that Credit Suisse hedges being on the short side of these notes by replicating the underlying index?

this is VXX's profile: "" The investment seeks return linked to the performance of the S&P 500® VIX Short-Term Futures Index TR. The ETN offers exposure to futures contracts of specified maturities on the VIX index and not direct exposure to the VIX index or its spot level. The index is designed to provide investors with exposure to one or more maturities of futures contracts on the CBOE Volatility Index""
VXX derives it's value from the VX futures. (many different months)  and what essentially happens is that Futures will decay over time.  take an example: storm today, lot's of damage. Futures of March go up like crazy.  and perhaps, even the futures of May.
Now, ask you self: ""since may is two months away, am i expecting that things will get more worse than today?""  Now note the distinction:  I'm not saying, or asking: hey will the stock market be down further in May than where it is today.  I'm asking: will the sudden shocks continue to rise more than where they are today?
so generally, the answer will be no.  Because, the market can continue to fall but, VIX itself does not have to keep rising. I may even fall...Because, the market is falling ""normally"" and not via shocks.
in a recession environment, it could lead to elevated VIX and VX...say it starts hovering around 20s.
so, generally, what you'll find that VXX spikes up like it has recently only because of large shock awe moves by the VX futures.  once that shock/awe is reduced, even if we go into a recession, VIX/VX will fall.
i realize that i'm not being totally clear: but, i hope this does spark some thoughts. I'll check in later.",,

The spike kills -1 ETFs like XIV and the ensuing vol crush terminates 2x long vol like TVIX.
It's still very exciting to make money during crashes and not just watch. Forgive my longish comment here. I have some other tickers in mind to play the down time that you can test.
what about:
​
VXZ (Long 4-7 month VIX. Volume is lowish). Perhaps half portfolio exposure is better)
SH (SPY -1 inverse)
PSQ (QQQ -1 inverse)
​
SHY (1-3 Year Treasury. Low returns, but less impact by interest hike)
TIP (Track inflation and least affected by hikes)
​
Other TBill ETFS like IEF and TMF have larger moves, but need diligence to FOMC policy because raising rates will hit them hard. The secular trend of low interest may be coming to an end as we approach zero so I'm  not sure how much longer it will last. You'd do a manual override in response to bad rates news. For extreme risk TYD and TMF are the 3x versions. TMF is very liquid.
You can use leverage with shorter term bond ETFs if they show good results and less drawdown than IEF.
Gold is a very bad hedge during extreme bearish conditions because it tanks with the market.
​
Edit:
A research article on hedges concludes shorting oil is the best hedge still working in investors' favor. Going long USD with $UUP has muted upside due to ZIRP and counts as ""fighting the Fed"". Treasuries same boat. Call selling against a cratering portfolio is a drop in the bucket. Puts are expensive and don't earn the windfall many imagine.
seekingalpha   com/article/3820876-sell-hedge
There's no good -1x inverse oil futures ETF for taking the opposite trade to USO. You can short it, but I have no idea what borrow rates and contango/backwardation effects will look like in backtests.

The VIX is a CBOE index option where the price is calculated off the implied volatility of SPX options contracts. This used to just use the monthly expirations and have a big jump when expirations pass, but recently they’ve updated it to incorporate some weekly expirations which reduces the impact of monthly expirations on the index. 
Now, VX futures are simply trading against the price of
VIX at the defined expiration date. You can be trading the closest month or as far out as the contacts are trading. VX is not tied to the formula that VIX uses so it can be bid up/down on the whims of the market.

I have been doing it for many years, although not as much opportunity now then there used to be.
The settlement of the VIX on expiration, is based on the opening prices of the SPX  options that will be listed in my  link.  You will be able to see exactly how many options for each series and at what price they are offered and bid.  So for example say there are options offered pointing to a mark down.   You know that say, the 1900 puts went out the night before with a .05 bid  and say the 2400 puts went out with a .20 bid.  On the CBOE site you see that there are 5000 2400 puts offered at .05.  The play would be to put a bid in at .05, knowing that the price is being pushed down on the opening only do to orders for the VIX settlement.  You would have an ""edge"" here buying at .05
​
You can do this with higher priced options as well, but there is very little risk doing it with the very cheap options as your downside is generally limited to a scratch.
The CBOE has implemented this system to try an curb any manipulation.  They feel the more market participants there are, the less likely one group can push the VIX settlement up or down.
Check out the link on Wednesday morning before the opening and you will see how it works.

I would definitely say the futures themselves are probably better to watch (and in fact I watch those myself during the day) but they are still ""moving target"" instruments as well.  But you are at least buying the same thing day to day - VXF20 is always tracking the value of VIX on Jan 1, 21.",,

The VIX calculation is still doing it's thing, people just don't want to accept that index investing is changing market dynamics.  The ""VIX is broken"" argument only makes sense if you think that index money all gets pulled at the same time when VIX is low, leading to volatility that was previously hidden.  In other words: that index investing is concealing some underlying volatility (by suppressing VIX) that will rear up at some point.   There is no evidence this is what would occur, though, and I think the opposite is actually true. 
If people continue to index (and I think they will) then you have a constant source of flows into the market as long as the people indexing have jobs - and a constant outflow as people age out of equity and into fixed income.  Even in recessions, the kind of people who regularly contribute to markets tend to stay employed.  Moreover, as faith has grown that the markets recover and economies grow in the long run, I still think we see more money enter the market even in brutal bear markets.  All of that will ACTUALLY suppress vol, not falsely suppress vol. 
I like to think of the growth of passive investing as a voluntary pension fund that people choose to participate in.  In this ""pension fund"", people contribute when they are working and then start to drawdown in retirement.  If enough people agree that it works and act accordingly, it will.  That will be a significant force in the market in the long run, as you would essentially have a bunch of money DCAing into the market *constantly*.

Another way of saying this if is you add more passive investing to the market, the Cash VIX, primary intended use as a risk guage will be affected, because of how the different investing styles effect it's calculation indirectly.

Perhaps you could build an analogy using simple words or simpler concepts when first explaining an idea to someone, but for those already familiar, they are expected to know the jargon to save time during discussion.
I'm going to disagree with your speedometer analogy and offer another one instead: Imagine a tug of war between bulls and bears (buyers and sellers).  The bulls opt for the slow and steady pull, but the bears go for those quick yanks.  In the long run, the slow and steady bulls win, but every once in a while the, bears can generate enough force to quickly yank the bulls of their feet.  Pretend that VIX is the measure of how much that little orange ribbon in the middle is expected to move given the current strength, attributes, and quantities of people on each side.  The rise of index investing essentially means you have a group of people who are ALWAYS on the bull side.  No matter what's happening, they are always going to that bull side and pitching in.  Many of them aren't even pulling at their max effort, so they have some extra capacity to give an extra tug if it looks like the bears are getting the upper hand.  Moreover, a few bulls are sitting by the side with entire teams of fully rested pullers, ready to jump in if bears start winning.  Institutional put sellers constitute another huge force of ""people on standby"" ready to jump in and pull if needed.
IMO, that's why vol is being ""suppressed""*, and I don't see it changing until 1) people lose faith in index investing in the long run (extremely unlikely anytime soon) or 2) the people indexing start losing their jobs.  I would argue this is further unlikely, as the people making the greatest contributions are probably just sort of the people least likely to lose their jobs, even in a recession.  That is very different from thinking that vol is artificially suppressed or that the VIX isn't sending the usual signals.  The market dynamics have likely just changed enough that we need to alter our perception about how to interpret the VIX.
*Is it really suppressed, though?  We continue to have vol actually quite a bit higher than realized vol, indicating the market isn't getting complacent.  The last couple of months have had a very high VRP.",,

The Speedometer being broke was just a random example of how one variable being changed (tire size) can throw off a primary gauge, nothing more.--------
Here's how I think passive money is affecting the Spot VIX IMO. Passive money is generally not hedged. The more money that goes into passive management, the less money goes into active management. If there is less money in active management there is less money that would be hedged....Less money for hedging means fewer SPX Put options will be bought at a lower price because of less demand. Also, lowering the price of Oprions even further, is Premium selling, which has became mainstream. This is just a hypothesis. Likely there are other factors at play including the ones you mentioned. But unless I have it wrong SPX Option prices sets the VIX. If the Options pricing dynamics change. The VIX will  change",,

I hear you on the speedometer gauge analogy, I'm just disagreeing that there is anything wrong with the VIX (the speedometer) because of a data input.  It's more like ""your speedometer still works perfectly, but it's biased downward now because you are on a steep upward grade.""  I think there is something we need to change about our interpretation of the VIX, taking into account new market trends.  In other words: options pricing dynamics haven't changed, participants in the market are simply organizing themselves differently.  VIX isn't a complete indicator, and secondary indicators probably need to be considered. 
If your main interest is the meaty part of the VRP that is available and assessing fear, you could look at VOLI-VIX or TDEX, as that would be a better indicator of tail hedging activity, which is probably a more pure measure of ""fear"".",,

It makes no mention of different ways to short vol, or how those might be incorporated with any other strategy.  For instance, shorting VIX ETPs outright can be very dangerous as opposed to using options to make the same play.  Sizing matters, too.  For all the smug derision levied towards trades of SVXY/XIV, no one wants to point out that even a fairly insane 70% allocation to short vol with no strategy whatsoever handily beat the market by 7pts per year.  That is: if you had 70% SVXY and 30% SHV, re-balanced monthly, and didn't even make any changes regarding going to cash based on contango or curve structure or anything AND held through volpocalypse, you still beat the market by 7% per year. 
I also really hate the constant negging of Seth Golden as a ""Target manager"".  Like any investor started out as a successful investment manager and never worked another job first?

Yes.
Any financial transaction has a gain and a loss. If you decided to buy a share of SPY 10 years ago, you've gotten the gains for 10 years from those companies. The person that sold you the share has foregone those 10 years of gains. That is not to say that they have strictly had negative returns, but over a set time horizon only one of the two parties ended up with something worth more money(unless there are more transactions which there usually are). Those additional transactions and variable time horizons make it so investors may not feel like they lost, but every transaction fundamentally has someone walk away with a more valuable asset.",,

So $27, then $26, $25, etc.  $500 will last you to the next split.  
​
The fuzzy part is how to define your exit from the long position.  If this grinds down to $20, you'll need an 18% spike in UVXY just to break even on your long position.  If it grinds down to $15, you'll need a 40% spike.  We get 10% spikes almost monthly so maybe you can increase your position as UVXY moves lower but now you're falling into the bettor's fallacy.  
​
If you want to play the long side, what about buying an OTM call?  You can get a Jan'20 40 call for about $500, and roll it each month that UVXY doesn't spike so you don't lose too much.   I've read of UVXY short traders who buy OTM calls to sell calls against and just consider the loss in value of the long call to be the cost of getting into the trade.
​
Buying UVXY or UVXY options with the plan that you can profit on a spike is not my play, so I advise against it.  You never know when VIX will spike, so this is hard to time.  You do know that UVXY will go down after a spike (usually very quickly), so the short side is easier to time and more forgiving.",,

​
The volatility of UVXY options adds a lot to their value.  I've had short put spreads that gained value when UVXY popped, just because of the IV component of the options.  Right now VVIX (volatility of vix) is low, and IV & actual volatility on UVXY are low, so this is a good time to buy an option.  
​
A put diagonal is great right now since if UVXY spikes then the short put will be in profit from the delta and there's a good chance the long put will be OK from the IV - you can buy back the short, or just close the whole thing.  If you want to do the long side, a call would obviously benefit from the price move and the IV and could work out nice if the timing is right.",,

I'm trading in an IRA, so I can't short shares, and the puts seem to address the assignment risk of a call spread - getting assigned here would mean my long put is well into profit.

I've been paper trading this for a while and trading live for a few months.  It handled the December UVXY spike about like you would expect - major loss in value, but my expirations were quit a ways out.  Keeping money on the sidelines let me get better pricing as spike increased so I could get out in February/March with a nice profit.
​
Right now I have adjusted my strategy a little - I have long January'20 puts that I am selling shorted dated puts against, well below the current price.  If UVXY continues to decline over the next couple of weeks then I'll close out of the trade at a profit.  If UVXY spikes, then I can take profit on the short puts and enter another short.

XIV and other vol ETP's never claim to track the VIX. They explicitly say this in the prospectus. 


The ETNs are not linked to the VIX Index
The ETNs are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying Index, which in turn is linked to prices of futures contracts on the VIX Index. The applicable underlying Index takes notional long positions in futures contracts on the VIX Index. The Index and these futures will not necessarily track the performance of the VIX Index.


The acceleration clause stating that if the note's IV was equal to or less than 20% of the prior day's IV did not make XIV any more risky. Its just something that would happen if XIV fell 80% in a day. The acceleration itself didn't lose anyone any more money than if it didn't happen.
The note's IV can never be negative.


A negative index level is possible for inverse and leveraged indices, particularly for inverse indices that apply leverage. In the event that this situation occurs, S&P Dow Jones Indices will publish an official close index value of zero on the day that the index closes at a negative level. For all subsequent intraday and official close index level calculations, the index will be held at a level of zero.",,

Although its never claimed and explicitly stated in the prospectus, the fact remains that if you were to look at a chart of XIV and the VIX you would see a very defined inverse relationship with slight deviations. In my video I linked another video in which I stated that I'm condensing this into a much more simple explanation. I go on to explain quickly how VIX is truly tied to the the 2 futures but is ultimately linked to the VIX loosely as way of beginners to grasp the concept.
Although  it can't become negative the point of the explanation was to wrap the viewers mind around the fact that a inverse can only go down 100% while the upside remains unlimited on the other side. You're right it can't go negative it can become worthless.",,

Retail traders see products like XIV and VXX and do a quick google search to see what they are. ""Oh XIV is inverse VIX and VXX tracks the VIX. Cool easy enough"" and then they load up on either product when they think the conditions are favorable. A mean reversion is a simple strategy that an unknowing trader might follow that is very bad for these products. The next day they see VIX down 5% but XIV is also down 1% because VIX is so high and the futures need to converge towards them. They lost money because they didn't know what they were trading. 
I'm not saying you clearly said that XIV tracks the inverse of VIX. I'm just saying it is important for people to hear right from the get go that XIV is not inverse VIX, it's inverse VIX futures, because a lot of people won't do anymore DD than that.

The S&P/ASX200 VIX (A-VIX) is a measure of implied volatility and provides a gauge of market expectations of near-term volatility in the Australian equity market. Similar to the CBOE Volatility Index which measures the volatility in the United States, the A-VIX can indicate investor sentiment and market expectations in Australia.
A relatively high A-VIX value implies that the market expects significant changes in the S&P/ASX 200, while a relatively low A-VIX value implies that the market expects minimal change. This characteristic often results in the volatility index moving inversely to the Australian equity benchmark index, the S&P/ASX 200.

The second point is a tricky one.  On the day of expiration, the Index contains 100% new M1 - that's why vixcentral kind of front-runs that.  As far as the data though, the old M1 settles at open.

On point 1, your calculation jives with my thinking (but I'm an accountant / IT person by trade, not a finance guy) so I figured there may be some underlying reason for basing the denominator on M2. I actually found the calc that he is using here (see PD4) and it is the finance representation of a ROC calc: (1 - M1/M2) whereas the vixcentral one would be (1 - M2/M1). Since I'm using vixcentral as a quick visual check and their calculation is the same as my initial thought process, it makes the most sense to me to use that one, as you suggested.
On point 2, this provides a bit of a quandary since we are talking quant calculations here. Ultimately, I'm using this spreadsheet and calculations to fact check some algorithms I've been playing with on quantconnect which means you have to have a data source. 
On one hand, fudging it by a day (a la vixcentral) does seem to have more consistent movement in terms of a trend when you look at the result over the period leading up to and following the settlement date. Most months its not too bad, but in the example above you're looking at solid contango versus solid backwardation at a given point in time. Just glancing at a random selection of those dates, using the straight CBOE data tends to cause more drastic changes in the trend that then reverse after the settlement date.
On the other hand, I don't see a simple way to make an algorithm that can take that into account. 
The VIX/VXV method of measuring contango seems to provide a more stable result across settlement dates, however you're adding another month to the spread there and I am guessing that you would lose some agility in terms of getting a signal to get out of a position before the hammer falls...",,

Based on fundamentals (unemployment, GDP, earnings, etc.), it is difficult to make this argument. If you're waiting for a crash, you could be waiting years. Waiting for a ""crash"" and then shorting vol is going to be a more crowded trade than shorting vol right now as all the people who think they are geniuses will think the same way. Even if you're expecting a crash, you can still buy short-dated VIX puts and make it out in time. Markets >90% of the time overestimate expected volatility which is why ex post realized volatility tends to be lower than ex ante expected volatility and long vol has a negative roll yield. A prudent vol strategy would be A) not taking large 1st entry positions in proportion to your portfolio and B) catching the end of a vol run. B is more of an art than a science. Even if you buy in too early, VIX tends to have a strong mean-reverting quality (left bound, skewed right with most of the clustering sub VIX 20 level), which means you can double down your bet (hence don't take too large positions to leave this recourse option open).",,

backwardation was not the time to be long.

Meh, backwardation isn't great, but it's not like every time we're in backwardation we're at risk of a wipeout event. Every other time in the history of XIV it had been safe to baghold through backwardation because XIV came back every time relatively quickly. I'm sure he thought this would be another one of those times.
Hell, some of XIV's best return days can be in backwardation when things are most volatile. It's just risky.

I was watching The Beauty and The Beast with my wife Monday evening when the market started to drop a lot.  At the time I was extremely invested in the market - 100k in XIV and 280k in UPRO.  I have always held through ""events"" in the past and did my best not to watch it.  Things started to improve a bit part way through the movie.  By the time the movie was over it was starting to fall off.  I briefly considered closing out the position (I had the prior Friday as well) but I have the philosophy not to mess with my positions at all except for scheduled rebalancing out of XIV.  So even though I wanted to close my position, definitely all of my instincts were telling me to, I was disciplined and didn't.
Instead, I went to sleep.  I woke up at 6am and checked my phone to see how it played out.  Google opened to a chart of the VIX and I was shocked to see it read 30+.  I quickly did the math and realized pretty fast what this probably meant.  Opened up the broker account and sure enough I saw the -95k loss on XIV (and big loss on UPRO as well).
