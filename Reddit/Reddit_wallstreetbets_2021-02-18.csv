Multiple trillions will enter and while much will seek safe stocks like big tech or whatever, much will go for more speculative boom/bust sectors...Why? Because there's no comparable sources of return out there.  Everything else looks like crap compared to stock returns right now.So it's not worth blowing up your account chasing one bubble when the next is just around the corner.  None of these are once in a lifetime opportunities, they aren't even once in a year opportunities.  There will be many more to chase as long as you still have money in your memefolio.Always focus on the next one and be willing to turn the page if you watched one run but never pulled the trigger.  If you were watching RIOT at $5 or $10 or $20 or $40, then $80 isn't the time to get into it."

Robinhood restricting trading, causing a huge wealth transfer back to Melvin and the other shorts. But I believe Robinhood was a smokescreen for what's really going on.When we squeezed the hell out of the hedgies, they weren't going to just sit and take it. We know that 40% of Robinhood's revenue comes directly from Citadel Securities clearing our retail trades. Recent litigation from a couple months ago shows us exactly how the system works: Robinhood makes money from routing our trades for shitty execution at these clearing houses.But what happens when the clearing house is about to get hit hard by a short squeeze on their hedge fund arm? The one lever they have is the capital requirement firms like Robinhood have to meet/deposit to clear through them.Vlad gets on TV and tells us that the clearing firms were asking for hundred of millions in deposits from his firm, driven by volatility. While Robinhood could cover, they had no idea how high these requirements would get and panicked. And rightfully so, because Citadel Securities blew the capital requirements out of control.The brokerages didn't make these decisions because they wanted to, they made them because they HAD to.Now the political and media madness points a cannon at Robinhood and the real story remains hidden. Don't be fooled. The hedge fund establishment took back billions and suffered barely any blowback. They're happy to see Robinhood and others go under for their own personal gain.TLDR for the crayon eaters: Robinhood was used by Citadel to take the fall while the hedge funds took back billions"

According to the DTCC website firms can see the VAR and collateral requirements hourly through their portal - the whole story stinks.There is NO WAY that retards from robinhood had enough positions at stake to a) Require 3 billion in collateral or b) Justify Robbin the hood to ban GME share purchases. The reality is Robinthehood had to cover all the call options that WSB retards held by buying them on the open market - to avoid them losing a lot of money they simply stopped letting anyone else buy. The reality is there was never 3 billion at risk because that would require billionaire hedge funds to hold multimillion dollar positions with Robinhood which we all know doesn't happen. Robinhood also claims only 3% of their clients use margin which makes the whole thing even more BS.Due to member requests, new features have been added to the interactive NSCC Risk Client Portal and API. In addition to the existing functionality, the enhancements will allow member firms to review 15-minute intra-day slices instead of hourly slices to monitor fluctuations in VaR and exposure to help anticipate potential intra-day margin calls. NSCC is also extending slices past 4:30pm, until 7:00pm, to allow for a better forecast of next-day risk clearing fund requirements.To further enhance transparency, DTCC also plans to release the detailed algorithm of its VaR formula within the portal for clients to consume providing the ability for client in-house replications of the NSCC VaR formula within their applications. This will be made available within the next coming weeks.As an element of NSCC’s overall service, the Risk Client Portal’s simple interface empowers firms to make better decisions for their portfolios, utilizing real-time insights and historical trend analyses. The risk monitoring dashboard provides an at-a-glance breakdown of risk exposure, as well as 30-day trend lines that highlight key metrics such as total risk requirement, volatility and more, so firms can be proactive in making risk management decisions. With the VaR (Value at Risk) Calculator available in the portal, firms can create their own “what-if” scenarios to model changes to their portfolio and instantly see the resulting risk requirements."

She continues, Even the wider market effects potentially attributable to the GameStop phenomena, like the dip in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were mild and short-lived.And remember that the dude in the video said this to some Media. Ms Schulp will be reading the above into sworn Congressional Testimony tomorrow.Berkshire Hathaway stock is like $370,000 a share. Lindy & Sprungli AG $8,887. Amazon is $3,237. There's plenty of space for the stock market to handle stocks in the thousands, tens of thousands, and even hundreds of thousands. GME going to those ranges would have done nothing negative to the market, as leftover assets from imploding HFs would be gobbled up by other HFs as they went bankrupt (see also, every single fucking time the market does crash - the things that bankrupt just get eaten by bigger businesses).This dude is simply a rich fuck trying to make Retail out to be a bull in a China shop and the Rich out to be a steady hand on the market. He's talking like he's going to bat for us, but I'll take the sworn testimony in bold above over anything some rich fuck goes on MSM to spout off.Edit /u/Jb1210a makes a good point that also shows this rich dudes BS doesn't pass the smell test: If it was so dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system, why the hell didn't Fidelity (and other brokerages) disable the buy button as well? I was using TDA and rode it up, able to purchase without a problem. Obviously TDA and Fidelity didn't think GME purchases were gonna collapse the whole system lol. Please, if you learn nothing else, remember not to take anything that rich Boomers say at face value. They're always hiding an ulterior motive, and they do NOT have your best interest in mind until they've put their money where their mouth is.Edit 2 ITT: People who can't cope with the fact that the rich shut the money off out of self preservation, and instead want to believe it was shut off for the good of the entire American economic system. Don't let the rich deal you Copium."

They would have had to buy every share in existence then do it again 4.2 more times. Every single time they purchased all of the shares to return to their rightful owners, they'd have to by their own rules, go back into the market and beg these same people they just returned shares to, to sell them back so they could return them to someone else. And they'd have lost everything to do it, and when they had nothing left, the Citadels would be on the hook, and then the big banks.

I know what I did, and the warning signs were there, Robinhood being fuckheads, media etc. Still 💎🤚 but for actual stock value now. Just bought into the dip today too."

It’s really time that we “protect the hedge funds” by putting a cap on their amount they can short, restricting publishing of “short reports” to only before they open their position, tracking and disclosing daily short interest in a stock, and disallowing any further shorting (except MMs hedging puts that we buy) when the short interest ration exceeds, say, 10% of float.

Take a long walk off a short pier with a rock. How many people were you going to send to the unemployment line so your 3 BILLION dollar hedge fund can earn a little more money.  How many more tax dollars have to be used to pay unemployment to those people so your investors, who are far far far from being victims or in financial dire straights, get a lot richer?You wanted a deregulated system? Well here is a shit sandwich. We've all had a bite already it's time for you to take yours."

6.66949041e+17,27441000.0,Nectarine-Agreeable,Keith Gill / DFV's Remarks to Congress,Reddit_wallstreetbets_2021-02-18.csv,REDDIT,COM,"TESTIMONY OF KEITH PATRICK GILLBEFORE THE U.S. HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICESThank you Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, members of the Committee.Before I go further, I want to be clear about what I am not. I am not a hedge fund. I donot have clients, and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions. Iam an individual investor. My investment in GameStop and my posts on social media wereentirely my own.I did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for my own profit. I did not belong to anygroups trying to create movements in the stock price. I never had a financial relationship with anyhedge fund. I had no information about GameStop except what was public. I did not know anypeople inside the company, and I never spoke to any insider.As an individual investor, I use publicly available information to study the market and thevalue of specific companies. I consider a complex array of factors and track hundreds of stocks –all in search of market inefficiencies. Like many people, sometimes I post on social media mythoughts and analysis about individual stocks and whether they are correctly valued.I did that with GameStop. I believed the company was dramatically undervalued by themarket. The prevailing analysis about GameStop’s impending doom was simply wrong.A little about my background: I grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts. My father was atruck driver, and my mom a registered nurse. I was one of three kids, and the first in my family toearn a four-year college degree when I graduated from Stonehill College in 2009, amid the GreatRecession and without a long-term job. My first post-college job was in operations at W.B. Mason,an office supplies company headquartered in my home town of Brockton.1 Between 2010 and 2014, I worked for a family friend at a start-up company in NewHampshire, trying to build a software program that would help investors analyze stocks and offerrelated research. We also tried to start an investment firm, which dissolved not long after it wascreated. My salary never exceeded $40,000, but I did learn something about investing. I learnedhow to do the tedious work of digging through a company’s financials and focusing on its reallong-term value, not prevailing market sentiment or headlines.I married my wife Caroline in 2016, and I found a job working operations and complianceat LexShares. I left that job in March 2017, and for the next two years I was effectively without ajob. During that time, I began actively analyzing a wide array of stocks to try to keep and increaseour limited savings. It was both a way to make money and an interest that I pursued passionatelywhile I lacked a job.In April 2019, I accepted a marketing and financial education job at MassMutual. Carolineand I were both happy about our prospects. I had never made a salary over $100,000 a year before,and I was thrilled just to be working and to have benefits again. My title was Director, FinancialWellness Education. My job was to help develop financial education classes that advisors couldpresent to prospective clients. I never sold securities, and I was not a financial advisor.I continued analyzing stocks on my own time and investing my family’s funds. In earlyJune of 2019, the price of GameStop’s stock declined on worse than expected earnings, and itbegan trading at a deep discount, below what I thought was its fair value. I was aware from publicreports that a well-known investor, Michael Burry, was interested in GameStop. Because I thoughtthe stock was undervalued, I purchased call options on June 7, 2019. I increased my positionthroughout much of 2019 and 2020, because as I continued to analyze the company and its2 prospects, I became increasingly confident that the share price was indeed dramaticallyundervalued.Two important factors, based entirely on publicly available information, gave me and manyothers confidence that GameStop was undervalued in 2019 and 2020. First, the market wasunderestimating the prospects of GameStop’s legacy business and overestimating the likelihoodof its going bankrupt. GameStop, the only major retailer dedicated to gaming, has over 60 millionmembers in its loyalty program and continues to maintain a sizable market share within the gamingindustry. Its legacy business, comprised primarily of selling physical video games and relatedequipment within their stores, was likely to generate meaningful cash flow following the releaseof new gaming consoles in late 2020. I grew up playing videogames and shopping at GameStop,and I’m looking forward to buying a new console at GameStop. I knew the company had anopportunity to reinvigorate this business by improving customer service for gamers, upgrading itsonline presence, and offering complementary product lines such as PC gaming and accessories.Second, I believed – and I continue to believe – that GameStop has the potential to reinventitself as the ultimate destination for gamers within the thriving $200 billion gaming industry. Thenew console cycle provides GameStop a unique opportunity to pivot from a traditionally brickand-mortar mindset toward a technology-driven business that excels in gaming products,experiences and services. By embracing the digital economy, GameStop can pursue new revenuesstreams including larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, onlinetrade-ins, streaming services, and Esports. While I may be the only panelist here today who hadfaith in GameStop, I was hardly the only person who advocated these points or ones like them.Investors including Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, whose purchase of GameStop shares and3 advocacy with the GameStop board helped positively affect the share price in late 2020, publiclyexpressed similar views.I want to pause to note that the investment I made was risky, but I was confident in myanalysis, and I was willing to accept the loss if I was proven wrong. My timing was far fromperfect, and many of the options contracts I purchased expired worthless because GameStop’sstock price remained depressed longer than I expected.I’ve been asked why I decided to share my investment ideas on social media. Myinvestment skills had reached a level where I felt sharing them publicly could help others. I alsothought that by sharing my own ideas and accepting critiques, I would be able to identify holes inmy analysis. Hedge funds and other Wall Street firms have teams of analysts working together tocompile research and critique investment ideas, while individual investors have not had thatadvantage. Social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and WallStreetBets on Reddit areleveling the playing field. And in a year of quarantines and COVID, engaging with other investorson social media was a safe way to socialize. We had fun.The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors ispreposterous. I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and thatmy aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out thechannel. Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis – myfocus was on the fundamentals of the business. It’s worth noting that after five months ofstreaming, my final stream of 2020 topped out at just ninety-six concurrent viewers, with anaverage view duration of twenty-five minutes. On Christmas morning I had only 529 subscriberson YouTube, and 550 followers on Twitter. These numbers are tiny. There were rarely more thana few dozen folks on the stream on any night. The reality was people didn’t really care about4 boring, repetitive analysis of GameStop and other stocks, and that was fine. For those of us whodid care, the stream provided us an outlet for refining our fundamentals-based thesis. We wereable to analyze events in real-time and keep each other honest.Ultimately my GameStop investment was a success. But the thing is, I felt that way inDecember far before the peak, when the stock was at $20 a share. I was so happy to visit myfamily in Brockton for the holidays and give them the great news – we were millionaires. Thatmoney will go such a long way for my family. We had an incredibly difficult 2020. In additionto dealing with COVID, we lost my sister Sara unexpectedly in June. It brought me tremendousjoy to share good news with my family for a change. I am grateful to be able to give back to mycommunity and to support my family, most of all my wife Caroline who has stuck with me throughvery tough times.As for what happened in January, others will have to explain it.Threshold lists, orderflow, halting purchases – according to the media these all had a material impact on GameStopstock in January. Here’s the thing: I’ve had a bit of experience and even I barely understand thesematters. It’s alarming how little we know about the inner-workings of the market, and I amthankful that this Committee is examining what happened. I believe an analysis of GameStop’srecent price action must start with a discussion of the exorbitant short interest in the stock, as wellas an investigation into any potentially manipulative shorting practices and brokers’ reportedfailures to timely deliver shares and settle trades.As for what I expect moving forward: GameStop’s stock price may have gotten a bit aheadof itself last month, but I’m as bullish as I’ve ever been on a potential turnaround. In short, I likethe stock. And what’s stunning is that, as far as I can tell, the market remains oblivious toGameStop’s unique opportunity within the gaming industry.5"

DFV actually believed in the stock, for WAY longer than most people on WSB who bought in for the short squeeze. Maybe take a little more of a look at the hedgefunds trying to short the stock into its grave and brokerages straight up removing the ability to buy while leaving the ability to sell.  Those behaviors seem a bit more questionable than a guy buying a stock and sharing his logic for doing so.

So if you bet right, you get to offer to sell them $100 worth of stock for $200, which they won't accept. But if you bet wrong, you might have to sell $200 worth of stuff for only $100.​If you sell covered calls above your own cost (I buy for $10, sell someone an option to buy for $11, and then am 'forced' to sell for a profit, I profited twice!), you can't lose, but this guy is an idiot.​He deserves no sympathy at all.

He went full bear on GME during one of the most bullish stock runs in recent history, and did it without owning the shares he was selling lol.  When you sell calls, the buyer has the right to exercise (just like you when you buy an option).  Say I had 100 shares of GME at $100, $10k value.  I sell 1 call for say 1/29 $160, and price shoots up to $400 on 1/28.  Like what happened here.  The buyer says, fuck yes, I want those 100 shares @$160 now, because it’s worth $400 each already, and exercised their option.  The option seller now has to sell their 100 shares to the buyers at $160.  So the seller made $6k (bought 100 @ $100, sold 100 @ $160) plus premium but lost out on additional profit of selling at $400.  But you still make money.But if you are like this dumbfuck, you sell $200k worth of call options without owning shares, then when the buyer exercised, you don’t have the shares to deliver.  So you are forced to buy them.  So dude had to buy @ $400 to acquire the shares and sell back at $160.  All loss.  To sell naked calls on a stock going straight up and not expecting to them to get exercised??? 😂"

It’s called covered because you would only sell an amount of calls equal or less to the number of shares you own in that security. You collect income for writing the call and take the risk that the call ends up in the money. But, you have an equal number of shares actually owned, so any amount the call is in the money is offset by gains in the underlying shares you own. It caps your upside at the price you write the calls at, since any losses above that call price would be offset by gains in the shares you own. Naked calls is selling a call without owning any shares. So you’re responsible for any losses above the call price. If stock goes up big the losses can be significant. Google the strategy, it’s pretty straight forward and good if you’re okay accepting capped upside."

If we have people buying a share per put, WSB can easily create a situation where there are no shares to short, especially if everyone opts out of the broker borrow program. This way they can't just sell the share you just bought back to you. They will have to create FTDs in the system to maintain their liquidity requirements. As well as using puts to force MMs to have naked short shares on their books.Selling puts and adding 1 share per put is probably the best way to handle this situation.This allows people to keep powder dry, take profits and buy more shares.I think this opportunity just became a siege situation and not a quick play.If you add to your DD pick how much money you are willing to spend and sell the put that directly correlates to that amount that would be great.My disclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only.

The short juggling shenanigans surrounding the ETFs, combined with the persistent and desperate FUD, suggests that likely many of the original shorts are still intact, but simply hid their positions to fool the bulls into thinking they closed. In other words, they nearly collapsed last time, and if the price rockets to that point again they have a good chance of being margin called. I don’t think we’ll see retail driving another bull run, since they’re burned out from the first effort, but there’s a sea of whales out there. I want to be positioned to capture the waves. The open interest (and continued daily volume) on 800c options for 2/19 and 3/19 is quite interesting.I agree though that the long-term prospects under Cohen’s leadership look rosy, and squeeze or not I’ll be in it for the long term."

There’s a big difference and I’d really like to know which.Edit: why does this appear to be completely false?“ Tax ReportingThe Internal Revenue Service requires you to declare your capital gain as soon as the stock becomes substantially worthless. Your capital gain is short term -- taxed at your marginal rate -- since you never owned the stock. If the stock price has dropped to a few pennies per share as the year ends, you might want to recognize the gain before the new year, even if the firm is not yet formally bankrupt -- you don't want the good folks at the IRS accusing you of delaying payment of your taxes. You report the gain on IRS Form 8949 as if you had covered the short sale at a price of zero. You also report the gain on Schedule D and on Form 1040 or one of its variants.”Source: https://finance.zacks.com/happen-short-stocks-bankruptcy-8444.html"

For every 100 shares you own, you can sell an option. The IV means implied volatility, which if it's high means options cost more. OP is implying that things aren't as volatile anymore, but people are paying for options as if they are. Ergo, selling an option that isn't likely to be realized will get you some decent money. It's still very risky, and you shouldn't do it if you don't understand it. Don't think I do, I don't.Keep in mind, when you're selling options (as in making the options instead of trading the options for money) things are a little backwards. When you buy 1 Call option you can execute to buy 100 shares, but when you create and sell 1 Call option you might be forced to sell 100 shares at the option price. So looking at OPs example, he created and sold a put option that forces him to buy 100 shares for $7000. He was paid $4200 for someone else to have that right. If the option expires and the price for GME is more than $70 he made free money. If the price for GME is less than 70 then he will pay $7000, but it will only cost him $2800 because he has the $4200; and if the price for GME is greater than $28 he can still sell those shares for a net profit."

Here’s what I’m getting from this: 1) Hedges over short GME 2) Retail buys GME to force a squeeze on shorts and now very ITM options 3) GME price peaks, not because of squeeze but retail demand trying to get in on the game 4) Rather than hedges doing what they are F-ing supposed to, which is actually buy the stocks to cover shorts and ITM options, they just say “sorry, retail has all the stocks and their too expensive so we’re just not gonna buy right now.” I know nothing of the fines for this, but paying the fine is probably cheaper then covering their positions at that point. 5) Since hedges are just failing to deliver and not covering their positions, GME price settles down because retail has bought all the appetite they could afford/Robinhood BS/paperhanded BS. 6) As days pass, hedges continue to just “fail to deliver” and so demand/price remain low 7)Continuing to keep it low by failing to deliver not only keeps 💎🙌🏻 from getting their juice but it also continues to push more and more options OTM (remember when the highest option was $90). So it seems like if the hedges were forced to cover, not only would they have the losses of already failed to deliver contracts to answer for, but that demand would have also caused a multitude more options to have been ITM over the past couple weeks. So failing to deliver feels like a manipulation of the market demand to also keep future options OTM as well. So many of those holders are also being cheated out of earnings by this continuous fail to deliver.Do I have all of that right? Or am I just a typical ape brain."

In fact, not a stock at all, but an ETF. Let's take a minute to look at what's happening with (X)(RT)Remove the brackets for the etf symbol, modds have been taking down any posts involved in this [not gonna address why at this point]This etf had a massive increase on failure to delivers, from 10,000 to over 2 million Failure to Delivers. This is something that just doesn't happen normally. Not only that, the short interest is the HIGHEST on the market currently, sitting at 180%. (do your own research or head over to other subreddits).But how does this relate to gamestok? This ETF holds 20% of its shares in gamestok. Not only that, but the exact date the FTD's spiked was the day it dropped on gamestok (January 29th.)Basically what happened is the hedges are shorting this other etf as a way to hide what they actually own in gamestok.Research this, look at any other subreddit. Hell, even just search the ticker on reddit and you'll find almost ever sub except WSB is talking about it (and not just the meme subreddits)I imagine this post will be taken down very shorty, so screenshot this or whatever you want to do, and do your DD."

While the popular narrative is that retail traders rose up to target hedge fund short positions, we do not have the data to know what portion of GameStop’s rise was attributable to retail investor behavior versus the behavior of other market participants. More so, we may never have the data to determine the diverse motivations of all the individual investors who traded in GameStop.But some things seem clear. Importantly, the temporary volatility in GameStop and others did not present a systemic risk to the functioning of our markets. As the Treasury Department recognized, following a meeting with officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the market’s “core infrastructure was resilient during high volatility and heavy trading volume.”https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-schulpj-20210218.pdf​Sounds like the potential of crashing the system has already been ruled out."

Despite the huge trading volume and rapid increase in value, the GameStop phenomenon affected a very small part of the market. GameStop’s market capitalization, even at its peak, was around $24 billion in an approximately $50 trillion market. it seems like she was basing this on the price of the shares before the halt, whereas the chairman was speaking on the potential price of the stock, going into the thousands, could it have gone to $1,000? 10,000? 100,000? who knows, but what is clear is they didn't want to find out, as they knew they would have to cover for it themselves, hundreds of billions of dollars potentially. so it's hard to say really, i would be interested to hearing her response to the chairman's statements."

Poverty has a tangible effect on intelligence measured by a drop in IQ.Wealth (and power) has been accumulating in pools for generations. This is what capitalism does. It's not a bug it's a feature.Now, imagine millions of everyday people extracting massive amounts of wealth from these pools through what would have essentially been an infinite money glitch that the developers were too lazy and greedy to patch. This money will actually trickle down through the economy through goods and services purchases, people starting businesses,etc. Until one day in the future the money will all settle and once again the snow globe will have to be shaken up.In the meantime, I wouldn't be too concerned about the frictional unemployment of a few thousand highly paid, highly talented hedge fund employees.

We can't let states do this, they won't do the right thing for the poor birds... when meanwhile the real issue is totalitarian federal control."

If push comes to shove, USA has agreed to a migratory bird treaty---there is gonna be some leeway for Indians, whether written into the treaty or not, but not to the point that they could just start slaughtering every migratory bird within their airspace, Mao style---didn't they try to kill all the birds in China? Maybe giving them better legal rights than human beings is too far the other direction ;)I am indigenous myself, international law is a fantastic thing, but it is very difficult to learn because even common law schools don't really teach much of it, ex cept from the point of view of their own domestic interests.For example, they don't teach white people that they're able to asert their own nationhood, says so in the UN Charter, everyone has the right to acquire a nationality, the state offers you their nationality, you can build your own.  IMO things like doing a land title system are now easy, like, the power of the 19th century Torrens System wa that it centralized records---now anyone with a $5 VPS can create a land title registry that is more accessible than any 19th century registry you had to visit in person.The registry is a record of facts, it's not the facts themselves, and if you are a nation, not a treaty person, there's no reason you cannot create your own land records.  But of course the Crown doesn't tend to teach indigenous people this in law school, they try to focus them on things like hunting/fishing.Also, they all want benefits, if they're status, so they don't really want to be completely independent, they still want to harangue government for money if they need a water filter, etc.  my nation never made any treaties, we buy our own food and water.  In Canada, actually, the battle is now between non-status nations that never made treaties and treaty-indians who are basically in the position of the Vichy French, who collaborated with NAzis, but somehow they want to claim they're the legitimate territorial government.It's a lot of fun =]"

I believe all tribes should be recognized as the U.S. government has been pitting them against each other for a century or more.I would only take issue with your characterization of collaborating tribes as Nazis in the sense that the Vichy government fit that description.  While many tribes on the North American west  coast regularly engaged in wars of domination, from what I've learned they typically did not kill their enemies out of racial animus.  If I'm wrong, please advise.In the U.S., unlike the E U, there is no recognized right for me to assert my own genetic identity because I am simply an American, for better or worse.  That right is reserved exclusively to tribes.I am firmly in favor of all treaties, including for migratory birds."

It means that to reach that number, they're using different accounting methods than the ones they're legally obligated to make. I'm not saying that in this case its the end of the world, but its an important statement because that number shouldn't be compared to the GAAP number that comes from other companies. I can only say that I personally disagree with the idea of using value relative to the rest of the sector as a benchmark, and share my reasoning. For one, it assumes, as a strategy, that the sector is priced the way it is at least in part because of value metrics, which as we know isn't always true. If the sector you're comparing against has bubbled because people are hyped about it and are betting on the companies they've heard of, then the valuation metrics don't really mean anything. Betting on a company with price to sales ratio of 7 because the rest of the market is at 15 ignores the probability that the whole sector will correct. When that happens in my experience the less popular companies get hit harder. Actual value investing, like what deepfuckingvalue does, is looking for companies with metrics that are actually good value, not just relative to a sector that's gone off the deep end. Usually it involves finding companies that kind of bum you out but have surprisingly good financials and an attractive price tag. They're still out there."

Car loan) the once you pay it off and if you can afford to.. keep that money out of play. My car was $650/month and when I paid it off I set up an account in Ally and did monthly deposits of $650 to that account so it was like forced savings. You can even do an index fund and invest that money monthly. Now when I buy my next vehicle I have a healthy amount to put down and also not worry much about monthly payments 2) Try to always pay off you CC in full monthly and if not just try to stay on top of it.3) with each raise/promotion, try to keep your expenses pretty flat and see if you can throw even a fraction of that into savings or increasing your 401k contribution.I’m by no means a financial advisor but these little tips has saved me over $100k in the last 5 years. Living inside your means and reducing going out to eat and making food at for an example will add up in a really positive way over time. Best of luck to you!"

They can completely automate all their transactions with triggers that react to market changes and go in before retail transactions. They can force retail transactionsto stop entirely when the market does something unexpectedly or is beyond their control.

They effectively used Federal Reserve type monetary policy to disincentivize buy side demand. If it is true that the FTDs were starting to stack up that would be a rather interesting thing, since the DTCC is the back stop for all trades occurring in the US markets. Which actually incentivizes them to implement policy to keep themselves from being bankrupt or having solvency issues.I think the GME trade may have actually caused the markets to blow up. In that as the price of GME mooned, hedgies would have been margin called, leading to their long positions being dumped on the market. This loss in value of various long positions would have caused some long only funds to start getting margin called, which when that happened we would have seen a chain reaction of explosions in a lot of the funds possibly even Fidelity, Blackrock and Vanguard. The most interesting thing about this situation is as GME mooned and good stocks crashed, GME and other meme stock holders would have been in cash, which would have been a huge transference of wealth across the markets.More interestingly though is the fact that with the sell side bias on trading, is the amount of options that went OTM. This would have forced so many shares to be short that theoretically we could have seen 30 to 40 million FTDs on a single stock after that day. Which would have been rather interesting when those came due.My disclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only. I am not a legal, tax or financial professional.

A lot more money was lost by bigger funds on Apple and a couple of other blue chipsRH has the most to lose in this situation, either they failed to have the necessary capital which would lead to additional regulatory review and likely crush their IPO chances or blame a system very few people understand.Edit: RH Shills are out to defend themselves"

The problem with the post-2008 regulations is they were more focused on the banks risk (not saying the banks didn't need it) and institutional investors kinda got a free pass. Ask anyone on the sell side (the banks) from that time period and they'll tell you the Hedge Funds were just as responsible, but since that's harder to message to the public the crusade was solely focused on the banks. Again not saying the banks didn't deserve it. If anything good comes out of this, they'll fix the flaws of having the regulatory burdens primarily on the banks and spread it across the industry. The banks, clearinghouses, and the DTCC didn't create this potential crisis. They just were the ones who had to step in to avert it, because they're the only ones bound by regulations to do so. Retail just got caught in the crossfire."

(Way easier than passing back and forth $100000 between accounts every 0.01 seconds). They also track the highest amount the broker owed them at any one moment in the day, and after closing they use (that + their judgment of how high it will be tomorrow + how likely it is that the broker will actually have all that cash to settle at the end of the day tomorrow) to assess whether that broker needs to deposit more cash before the next trading day.

About half the money I saved when I worked corporate evaporated in the stock market at the same time - I would've loved to buy at the bottom and actually was pretty close to calling it but had no money to do it.  I would argue that for many people the job market had already collapsed.  I'm sure it could get worse, but I've been homeless and jobless most of the year.... so maybe worse means I finally starve to death?And I may be wrong, but I'm almost certain what is coming is WAY worse than what would have happened if there was a flash crash.

That's their first problem - a zero-down margin for everyone (and a standard 25% down margin for larger amounts).In normal operations some of your customers are buying $STOCK, some are selling $STOCK, at the end of most days Robinhood probably owns roughly the same amount of $STOCK as they did at the start (*I don't even know where to look to see if that's true). But Robinhood had a heterogenous customer base that happened to be all going in on the same stock, and nuts. In GME times, RH had half of their entire userbase buying GME and very few selling, so they had to go to DTCC and buy the stock for all the transactions. As the stock went up, that meant their highest debit to DTCC went up way over the normal amount for the day. That's their second problem, and that one wasn't their fault.So at close of market Wednesday, DTCC looked at the debit RH had that day, looked at RH reserves, looked at WSB buying in no matter the price, and imagined the stock barely even going up, hitting $500 and RH users still buying it all day. There were 100million shares traded on Wednesday. RH has 13 million users. Let's say 500,000 of those users initiated a bank transfer and used that automatic margin loan to buy 5 stocks@500 on Thursday morning, and that all the other transactions cancelled each other out as in normal conditions. (*Remember, I haven't the faintest idea what the actual nets were). At close on Thursday, RH owes $1.25billion. Will RH really have that money ready, thinks DTCC? Hmmm. And imagine if it really did rocket to $1000 AND presumably add a smaller debit of the same kind for AMC, BB, etc - wow, that could be a $3billion debit pretty easily!  HMMMMM. Even if you only rate $1k as a 1% chance....So after that scary thought, they tell RH they need to put up $3billion by market open, to prove they'll have it there at market close if rockets, and surprise! they don't have that much cash on hand. And we haven't even talked about all the RH users who were actually trading on margin and might not even be able to pay the rest if they get called. I wrote this story for myself in crayon, and some of it may not be true because I don't know how this stuff works, check out my sweet GME@310."

Those are margin calls based on Robinhood's internal risk department. So when you trade on margin  you have to maintain a minimum amount of equity. Losses come out of your equity, the broker is just providing leverage. So when the losses get too high that Robinhood's money lent to you as margin is at risk, they issue a margin call and start liquidating those positions until you're back to the right ratio of equity to margin. (You can also just deposit more cash, but I'm guessing if you're buying fractional shares on margin, that's not really an option. Also Robinhood isn't really known for their customer service when it comes to margin calls and working with the client)"

My argument is that it was coordinated by the clearinghouse. Only a few brokers put true halts on purchases. Most brokers (larger ones such as fidelity) did not and just made users pay cash collateral for their trades. My suspicion is Robinhood got its margin call (which tbh, they should have been able to model out themselves if they had a proper finance department), which is has mentioned above includes a VaR calc. VaR can be calculated a couple of different ways but it’s function is to show the minimum expected loss x percent of the time. Using its simples method, it’s the the average value minus its volatility multiplied by a set number of standard deviations to get your confidence (likely 2.33σ, for 1% VaR). I would guess RH said they’ll limit the trading on an extremely volatile asset to lower how much they would have to post. If this really was as coordinated as you mentioned, they would have blocked all individual brokerages and the hedge funds would just sold through either dark pools or their prime brokers like the normally do. You do not run a brokerage without a risk department that will model the daily margin calls. Saying you don’t know how it’s calculated is honestly irresponsible on RH’s side."

If anything, the argument is either DTCC should have never negotiated down the margin call as the risks in the model are likely understated the risk or you support that DTCC forced RH from allowing buying to stop any contagion, which would then be correct market activities. The later is a bit hyperbolic, but I hope you get my point. Even exponentially I still don’t see how GME could have caused as much of an impact that people are saying."

And that he would spend his last dollar on the day he died. He retired early. Couldve kept working for the pay, but he was just fine living a modest life and spending time with his kids. I knew that we were well off and would never be destitute, and that's great. And he knew he had a better situation entering the workforce, so he wanted to make it easier on us by removing student loans.It was that confluence of situations growing up that allowed me to be cognizant of this trade, understand it, and see why it is right and just. I think it is much the same for your friend. If he was raised like a normal billionaire's kid, he wouldn't even have bothered to make the trade.
