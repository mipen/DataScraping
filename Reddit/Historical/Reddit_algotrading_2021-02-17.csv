In fact, there are many advantages to being a (automated) retail investor/trader. I won't distinguish automation as an advantage or disadvantage because it is simply a tool for executing strategies and not a strategy within itself. 
First and foremost, small trades (I mean <$100k or so, assuming a liquid enough asset) do not really move markets, allowing your positions to effectively realize the full intended movement at the time of entering the trade. Second, and perhaps more importantly, retail order flow is considered ""non-toxic"" and often allows you to get better fills. That's right - market makers DO NOT want to trade against sophisticated institutions and will actively try to avoid their orders. However, retail order flow is literally just considered noise (as for the most part, it is), so market makers love to trade on it (think Robinhood). No matter how sophisticated your strategies might be, your trades will be considered retail and gobbled up by market makers, providing you with better fills. 
The markets are so complex and there are so many opportunities for everyone involved. To think that ""I can't do this because someone bigger and smarter already does"" is defeatist and incorrect. Good strategies make money; bad ones don't - simple as that.",,

To address your question about alpha versus market momentum, I don't think you can truly separate them. Generate alpha by riding momentum in volatile times, until the volatility stops, then get out and go the other way. If you find counter-cycling stocks using a strategy like I use, you can actually set it up as a long-short hedge fund just passing your shares back and forth between each other.
My algo just generates the probabilities based on pricing every day and tells me when my probabilistic conditions are met and gives me a buy/sell signal. It's actually not all that difficult to do this.

market makers DO NOT want to trade against sophisticated institutions and will actively try to avoid their orders.
However, retail order flow is literally just considered noise (as for the most part, it is), so market makers love to trade on it (think Robinhood)

Can you clarify this please? It sounds like you’re saying market makers are able to pick-and-choose who they trade with. How would this be possible?
I had always assumed the stock exchange’s matching engine just takes orders off the book on a first-come-first-served basis, in groups for each price point. And I thought the order book was effectively anonymous, too.

In the long-only case, your winners get bigger relative to your losers over time. As your winners do better and better, your positive returns get compounded exponentially! Meanwhile, your losers just get smaller, mitigating your further losses exponentially! This song-and-dance runs its course and you usually end up doing better than if you had magically had the same weightage throughout the holding period. Basically, a well-diversified portfolio implicitly optimizes itself over time. Pretty cool stuff.
Shorting is effectively borrowing cash at a random, hopefully negative, compound interest rate. Even if you lose on your shorts, to make money from them you just need to profit enough on the cash which is initially yielded by the shorts; for example, by investing it long. Be careful though as short positions have the exact opposite effect as described above - your winners get smaller and your losers get bigger! This is why many firms employ a tried-and-true, yet sort of arbitrary, 1.3/0.3 long-short rule in their long-term investing.
TL;DR hold longer, use shorting but not too much, find creative ways to chose and rebalance lots of positions

Let's call our market maker MM for simplicity. At any given time, MM has a bunch of buy and sell limit orders placed on the books of stock X, and these orders are spread apart by $0.01 or so. They may also have some that are deeper, but the bulk will be close or at NBBO. They also will have lots of calls and puts written and/or owned on X but I will ignore that for the purposes of simplicity.
MM pays for order flow from brokerage B, and these orders are flagged to them as retail. So, when 1,000s of u/420chadleyjuulmaster's come along and place retail-flagged buy/sell orders on X through B, MM does not feel that their bid-ask is threatened and continues business as usual, making about $0.005 or so per trade (assuming roughly equal amounts of buyers and sellers). Now, let's say mammoth quant hedge fund BridgeShawSigmaTech (BSST) comes along and places a bunch of huuuuge buy orders on X throughout the books. MM may not explicitly know that BSST is associated with the orders at hand, but they have enough data to have a hunch, especially given the sizes and IDs associated with the orders, and of course the fact that they know the orders did not come from B. MM now feels threatened that these order are ""informed"", and that if they do not cancel or modify their current orders, the price of X could increase in a way quickly/violently enough that it will cause them to lose lots of money (i.e. they sold short a bunch of X the moment it crossed their limits, and so fast that they could not keep up to trade out of them, leaving them holding a stinky bag of bad shorts). To avoid this risk, MM either cancels their orders or heavily increases their spread. 
I like to imagine that since MM knows BSST or a BSST-equivalent wants to buy at near the current price Y (Y - epsilon), the ""true"" price is actually Y+1, so MM is effectively losing money by being willing to sell at Y.
MM's advantage comes from the fact that they pay for order flow and can basically distinguish between whose retail and whose not (and they also have some of the smartest talent and best technology).

No thanks.
According to their website, last year they got a 318% return vs Bitcoin's 277% return.
Suppose I started the year with the equivalent of $10K in my account. If Stoic's figures are before fees, then by the end of the year, the 10K would turn into $39,710 (10K.954.18). But just HODLing $10K of Bitcoin would have returned $37,700.
So Stoic would have made me 5.3% more than HODLing ((39710-37700)/37700), but I'm adding additional risk.
It seems like taking a manual strategy of repeatedly buying low and selling high would make you more money, although it would take more time.",,
