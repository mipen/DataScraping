Thank you for sharing. The correlation between social media chatter and positive price action must be quantifiable to some degree. I wish I had the time to dive into it more. Further to your point, I think you can mitigate risk by investing in penny stocks that follow secular trends and have a good amount of chatter associated with their tickers on social media. That's why I am investing heavily in the UAV ($TAKOF, $DFLYF), precious metal segment ($AMYZF, $MNXXF, and $MLLOF) and EV/ESG segment ($CRYBF and $ALYI). Even dark and defunct ""CE"" triple zero wonders are flying these days on rampant speculation. The OTC is really a poppin' place as of late and if you're patient and take proportionate bets, it is not hard to rake in substantial profits here.",,

In particular, I pay close attention to issued shares, when they were issued, to who, and how much.  Many of these companies seem like giant dilution machines.  Fake news, pump it up, dump it, change name, RS, rinse and repeat.  Gteh is a perfect example of one of those stocks that people here seem to be blind to.

If you look at their financials, you will see that they do not yet generate any revenue:
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABEPF/financials?p=ABEPF
Further, from their financial statement, periods ending November 2019 and 2020 (https://visionlithium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EF-2020-11-30-Final-An-2021-01-25.pdf), under their Notes section:

The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption, meaning the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations.
Given that the Company has not yet determined whether its mineral properties contain mineral deposits that are economically
recoverable, the Company has not yet generated income nor cash flows from its operations. As at November 30, 2020 the
Company has a cumulated deficit of $38,257,632 ($38,086,617 as at August 31, 2020). These material uncertainties cast
significant doubt regarding the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional financing to further
explore its mineral properties and continued support of suppliers and creditors. Even if the Company has been successful in
the past in doing so, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in the future.

The whole thing is worth reading, but I've excerpted and bolded some important points.
Bottom line: this company is fully dependent on whether or not their exploration projects yield minerals that are economically feasible to extract. I think any money you invest in them would be purely speculative, unless they release some positive news.",,

The price jump happens without any news. If a miner just announced they found lots of mineral deposits, or a pharma company just got some approval/results for their drug - the jump is justified. People are pumped on actual news, not on fake tweets.
There are scam companies that pump their own stock. The operation is a bit different. Easiest one to spot lately is $VPER (Viper Networks): take a look at their website (fake product), their twitter account (promises and hype), and their chart (notice the weird volume spike on Jan 21 without a change in price). Also, why would solar panels need 5G technology???

Thanks again for posting this. I started following the basic outline you put out here three weeks ago and tweaked a few things (there are certain sectors like pharma and oil/gas that I generally avoid) and found some real winners like KOPN, INPX, TAIT, DNN, and XPL that I got 20-80% returns on in a few weeks (set up a stop loss on TAIT and got out in time). Couple of duds (PPSI, though I plan to hold this for at least another month to see), but overall, great success. Thanks again.",,

I learned my lesson, if you're going in, you go in low. Find stocks that seem to have something going for them also. Usually all stocks have a P n D moment, but if it holds at a certain price, it means that people are believing in the stock long term. Another tip, and this is mainly luck, is if you see it dump hard, it doesn't mean it's a failed stock. It's usually people trying to drop the price or early investors, taking profits. Always do your DD, always see news of your stocks. Let's say a stock you invested goes bankrupt, if you read the news on time you can take out profits. READ READ READ. Also, never sell your total stocks, sell maybe 80% and let the rest ride, maybe that stock goes up further and you won't regret it as much. Some people will try to influence your mind, before you leave a stock, make sure many others have a similar opinion. Don't let 1 person decide for you.",,

The key is not to buy to late in the rocket up. 
What happens is the stock becomes over vallued very quickly.. it's usually pretty easy to tell when that happens DONT BUY but if your holding... You'll likely want to do some profit takeing as so many other people will to. Then it will drop back down but usually higher then where it was before the pump. Depending on the catalyst of the pump it may be worth getting back in or not.

Lots of bag holders there but the price hasn't moved back down. If you just go from penny stock to penny stock you'll notice most look like pump and dumps in the last 6months except many of them are now worth over 1$. 
If you see the pump.. wait for the initial profit taking to be over.. then evaluate.

You should be able to get a good idea of that based on how steep the chart is preceding your buying of it. If you see 100% profits, just take it and don't worry about what it could be unless you are deliberately experimenting with something you can risk (extra shares after taking investment and some profit, etc.).
I do not own DNN, but to me it looks like its increase is based on several pieces of recent news. I think it will always be the case that people find this news first, take advantage of it by buying, and then rely on that good news to get an increase, even by spreading it themselves. That means even real good news and hype can lead to a similar result as a pump and dump. I think a lot of that happened some years ago with weed stocks based on the charts I see (and what I think is happening with them again). If you still have it by the end of this month, you may want to sell because it looks like an earnings report may be released March 3rd. So I would think about short-term profits on this one. If you have a decent increase, take it because there will likely be a dip and volatility from the earnings report. I am new to this, but that is how I would play that.

Again bro can you read? I'm not talking about this month. I'm talking about the initial run up from when it was .50 cents in December. I'm talking about the three days where it went from .50 cents to $2. That would have fit his criteria
‚Äã
And the catalyst that came was a research paper done by BNGO itself that wasn't peer reviewed and ARK investments Simon stood by PACB. Long before the Genomics conference in January where they had an opportunity to explain. So because it was dead in the water for months, had a catalyst that was shakey at best from a company on the verge of bankruptcy, and had effing ARK telling the public it wasn't a big deal, the only thing I feel like would have saved the investor from selling was doing his DD and knowing that this was big shit.
‚Äã
And thats why when it went from .50 to 1.10 I didn't sell, I bought more. I bought more at 3 - 4.20  and even $10. But the initial push would have met this criteria for a pump and dump and I would have been one of those sad users selling at $2 if I listened to this advice.
lol didn't do the DD. Thanks for the laugh. My point is, thank you OP for explaining in laymen's terms what a pump and dump is, but if you're doing your DD thats literally all that matters, and I'm really just tired of people complaining about the pump and dumps on here as if they can't think for themselves. Let them lose their money if they can't read SEC filings and are going to trust strangers on the interwebz.
‚Äã
And as for not doing the DD, your comments clearly show you're making assumptions.

Playing on volatility and with patterns that bounce and dip a lot either daily or weekly,  you can more than often get up over 2.5% at some point , so you also put your limit at 2.5% get out repeat. 
You cant score 400 times in a row and I dont know why not scoring every move in a row is a problem.  if you win more than you lose and have a good overall growth, and  with calculated risks it looks doable. It requires to follow good infos constantly and you need to always be aware of stocks that will move, but these infos are kind of accessible with all the subs streamers and medias. You can go higher on some good plays and still set a 2.5% stoploss to protect if it goes down but when it goes up and you are up more than 2.5% take your limit sell at whatever % you are currently up and secure it , from there repeat if goes up and get out if its to go down. With the crazy markets right now you could do it multiple times a day with stocks that trade a lot and have the good patterns.
You need to get on the news and trending stocks , they fluctuate more. Right now buying puts on stocks that go mainstream looks and buying them back then selling them back again can give good results. Not sure how long this will last and I have yet to try it but if I had the time to invest into it im pretty confident it would work in this bull market. And after just going back to swing. 
Havent most of your stocks all been green by 2.5% at some point? Maybe I have been lucky but there are many stocks who just get down early and stabilize,  or the opposite. 
I dont want to make it sound like its instant money with no losses and all but I like the idea. If I was good at programming and calculating a bit more id do some macros to automate some moves like that. 
Why you think such a strategy would be that bad? And not talking about wanting to aim a perfect 400 trade run im confident not stupid. Well that stupid.",,

I'm not saying you can't make money on stocks. Ofc I've had stocks in the green.  My initial comment was vs ""It would only take 467 trades to turn 10 dollars to 1million"". That's just a misleading statement imo, with the ""just"". 467 trades of profit in a row is not easy in any form. And if you start losing basically any non-zero probability of the time, the trade count goes skyrocketing.

If you look through the pink sheet stocks looks like there are mostly two types.    Pink no information, won't work.   Pink current, will work.   
Sometimes when I sell a stock there's a 1 cent fee added on and I have no clue why it's on some sales and not on others.",,

The fact is that a lot of your trades will fail, especially if you are trying to day trade, but the point is to minimize risk and find stocks that are just about to explode. I used to have no idea on how to go about doing this, but just last week I found BRQS, NOVN and GSAT that all three gave me big gains, and there were indicators early on showing it would. When the volume starts to come in, then it's time to get out the charts, watch how it reacts to vwap and which way RSI is showing. That is how I have learned how to day trade with some success. I've also watched a lot of DFV's YouTube videos and I'm trying to be more patient and look at the bigger pictures now with companies. Lately I've been selling off my cost or taking a little bit of initial profit on a spike and letting the rest of the shares run into the foreseeable future until I see another good buying opportunity.",,

Yes, you can get around the day trade issue this way, but then you have new issues to sort out. 
There‚Äôs a difference between a margin account and trading with margin. Most accounts are margin accounts. Features that come with this are varied.
The biggest thing with a margin account is that you don‚Äôt have to wait for funds to settle after selling a stock and you can use those funds immediately to buy something else. Meaning that if you sell $100 worth of AAA stock, you can use that money immediately to purchase $100 worth of BBB stock if you have a margin account. If you have a cash account, you have to wait a number of days for those funds from selling AAA stock to settle. This means that with a cash account there can be delays in trading while waiting for funds to settle, unless you have a lot of cash to play with. 
My point is that you lose certain features by downgrading to a cash account, beyond the ability to trade with margin. I don‚Äôt trade with margin but I have a margin account. Most people have a margin account, even if they don‚Äôt know they do.",,

Of course different brokers vary, but quickly looking at Robinhood it seems that you need to wait for funds to settle when using a cash account.
‚ÄúIf you have a Robinhood Instant or Robinhood Gold account (both margin accounts), you have instant access to funds from bank deposits and proceeds from stock transactions. This means that if you sell a stock today, you can use the funds right away, instead of waiting the typical two trading days for access to those funds.‚Äù
And also, ‚ÄúA Robinhood Cash account allows you to place commission-free trades during the standard and extended-hours trading sessions. You won‚Äôt have access to instant deposits or instant settlements. You can downgrade to a Cash account from an Instant or Gold account at anytime.‚Äù

I have one question about dilution that you may know the answer to. Are there any rules for OTC stocks about when they can dilute other than that the shares have to be authorized?
I've seen people in various places claiming that a company couldn't be diluting for x reason although dilution was in fact happening. I never really believed them as it seems like dark defunct companies can pretty much do whatever they want, but always wondered if there was anything that could stop them.

When I say the word dilution, I specifically mean the leadership of the company issuing new shares to be sold on the market to raise money.
A company who is doing that will need to file paperwork to that effect, which makes it obvious what they are doing. The reporting requirements might differ between the OTC variations.
The convertible instruments I described above, however, (convertible notes, convertible preferred shares, and also one I did not mention warrants) are all sources of new shares that are not new dilution because they've already been recorded on the balance sheet. Since they were already there on the balance sheet, the company does not need to file any paperwork when these new shares appear. However, you will be able to find information about convertible instruments converting in the following 10-Q/10-K.
So the Outstanding Share count rising does not actually mean ""dilution"" is occurring as far as new dilutive action is concerned-- it can simply mean that old dilutive action is resolving itself into shares.
In a more specific accounting sense, ""dilution"" is adding new equity to Shareholder's Equity that you will balance with the Cash that you raise when you sell them.  Conversions of convertible notes, preferred shares, or warrants, is simply the redistribution of numbers from the ""liabilities"" section of the balance sheet to the ""shareholder's equity"" section. (Or from one ""shareholder's equity"" subsection to another).",,

So, just as an example, I'm looking at the filings for PLYZ (not trying to pick on any stock, but I know this one has diluted a lot). The most recent 10-Q (04/06/2020) shows only 300 mil authorized shares and I looked through later filings and can't find where they increased the authorized share count. Additionally, I can't figure out where this many extra shares would have come from based on the number of warrants, convertible debt, etc. They now have 25.5 bil AS and 16.3 bil OS. Apparently the float is only 46 mil (it doesn't really seem believable, but that's what OTC markets says. I think they may have missed a couple zeros).
Could you show me in the filings where it would have allowed them to add this many shares? I would really like to better understand these filings.",,

So rather than creating or utilizing expensive SPAC's, if you have a defunct junior mining company or small oil field company that is still barely staying compliant with the market listing requirements but has no real business, this is the perfect vehicle for these cannabis or psilocybin companies.  Cheap and easy and the bag holders on these mining and oil field companies are happy to help and recover their earlier losses on these companies.",,

Too often this place is an echo chamber. Thank you for bringing this up. 
1). From my understanding this approval has been years in the making. The FDA is postponing PDUFAs for best standard of care drugs right now, some life changing. I hate to say it but selling OTC hearing aids isn‚Äôt their highest priority right now. The FDA is busier than they‚Äôve probably ever been and have publicly said they are spread too thin. Take this into consideration. The bill has been approved it‚Äôs just a matter of time IMO
2) definitely concerning, but not as concerning if they don‚Äôt follow through with getting current. It‚Äôs definitely something to keep an eye on. If they miss their targets for getting current that‚Äôs a massive red flag for me. 
3) you must have not looked too hard because it‚Äôs listed on Walmart‚Äôs website. Valid concern over Amazon. The Bose hearing aid has potential as well but that article is a year old. A lot changes in a year. Definitely something to keep an eye on. I‚Äôm sure all the other competitors will be gearing up competition for them as well.

If you find something that has decent DD, it's not a brand new account, and isn't spammed all over reddit, then it's a possibility. From there check out Stocktwits to see what people are saying, go on OTCMarket and see how it is. Check the volume, if something all of a sudden had a ton of volume in a single day, you most likely missed it. If you see that it's already raised by a >300% in the passed few months, probably too late and should avoid.
Check out the company itself, do they have anything new upcoming, are they old, etc.

So whatever price they adjust their offering, share diluting will stop after they reach $4.5million.

The truth about OCGN is it‚Äôs either going to go to the freaking moon or it will be a painful, firey crash landing. 
Everything is currently hinging on Phase 3 trial results, and we should have at least some interim analysis by the end of this month or sometime next month. If this analysis looks good, the stock will run. Hard.
Next comes the EUA. From what I understand, it would be unprecedented for the FDA to give EUA on Phase 3 data from another country. But we‚Äôre living in unprecedented times and it seems like this is what OCGN is hoping for. Of course, the FDA could request additional trials conducted in the US before any kind of approval, but no one knows.
Like I said, I‚Äôm long. But it‚Äôs a risky time to jump into OCGN. There‚Äôs a lot of potential upside but if any of this goes sideways the stock will tank.",,

If this is the first vaccine in america kids can use before the fall semester it will be a 200$ stock, that's when i plan to sell right when supply of Covaxin meets the demand of kids needing it to reopen the school system fully and the first step back to normality",,

Personally I wouldn‚Äôt touch it. It‚Äôs a gamble on whether drugs get approval and if one fails this goes back down to 3-4$. Phase 3 imo is already priced in.

Several of Ocugen's staff had worked with Bharat researchers while at companies such as Pfizer and Merck ‚Äî and they had stayed in touch. ""
Here is the story of Ocugen and how they began a connection to Bharat /
While Ocugen has focused on developing gene therapy treatments for retinal diseases since its inception in 2013, the Malvern biopharmaceutical company expanded into a new arena two weeks ago.
On Dec. 22, Ocugen announced it signed a binding letter of intent with Bharat Biotech of India to co-develop Bharat‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine candidate for the United States market.
Since that date, Ocugen's stock price has increased almost 800%, from 29 cents per share to an opening price Wednesday of $2.60 per share.
Bharat's vaccine, Covaxin, received emergency approval from government regulators in India on Sunday.
Dr. Shankar Musunuri, co-founder and CEO of Ocugen, said the two companies are in the process of finalizing a definitive agreement. He could not, as a result, comment on the financial terms of the partnership.
Musunuri did, however, talk to the Philadelphia Business Journal about how Ocugen got involved in the battle against the global pandemic.
""People are losing their lives during this pandemic,"" he said. ""It's unprecedented. These are extraordinary times and people have to make extraordinary decisions.
Musunuri said biopharmaceutical companies around the world have looked at their technology to evaluate what role they could play in developing vaccines and therapeutics against the virus.
Ocugen was no exception.
""When we looked at our team and our network, we saw we do have pretty good vaccine experience,"" Musunuri said. ""So we looked at what we could do.""
That pursuit led them to Bharat, a 25-year-old company based in Hyderabad, India, with a product portfolio that includes more than 16 vaccines and four bio-therapeutics. Several of Ocugen's staff had worked with Bharat researchers while at companies such as Pfizer and Merck ‚Äî and they had stayed in touch.
""The biopharmaceutical industry is really a small community,"" Musunuri said.
Ocugen had followed Bharat's development of Covaxin. When Bharat began looking for U.S. partners, it started having discussions with Ocugen.
""We felt their technology was pretty strong,"" said Musunuri. ""We wanted to work with this vaccine. ‚Ä¶ This would be our contribution.""
Ocugen has put together a scientific advisory board to help guide the development of the experimental vaccine.
Covaxin was developed by Bharat in a partnership with the National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research. The vaccine was designed to protect people against Covid-19 by instructing their immune systems to make antibodies to block infections by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
The letter of intent calls for Ocugen (NASDAQ: OCGN) to get the U.S. rights to the vaccine candidate and, in collaboration with Bharat, be responsible for clinical development, registration, and commercialization for the U.S. market.
After the partnership was announced, Dr. Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat, said in a statement, ‚ÄúThe development and clinical evaluation of Covaxin marks a significant milestone for vaccinology in India. Covaxin has garnered interest from several countries worldwide for supplies and introduction and we are excited to collaborate with Ocugen to bring it to the U.S. market.""
India's approval of Covaxin generated some controversy, with some questioning the lack of transparency concerning late-stage clinical trial data given Bharat has not yet published results from phase-III studies.
Musunuri said he is aware of those concerns, but attributed them largely to the accelerated review process regulators are undertaking amid the ongoing pandemic.
""The data we have seen to date looks strong,"" he said, adding Bharat will be publishing results from phase-I and phase-II clinical trials in credible medical journals. ""[Covaxin] has generated a very broad immune response, which is important to any vaccine.""
Musunuri said Ocugen's foray into Covid-19 vaccine development will not delay its work on gene-based therapies for retinal disorders.
""Our programs are all going extremely well,"" he said. ""We have one program going into the clinic this year and two others going in next year.""

Or your shares get replaced with shares in the company buying (so you have less shares same $$$ value).

The plus is the value of the stock would spike a bit before the buyout.
There are a couple more possibilities as well.
They could just still exist as a separate entity with their own shares and just be owned by a conglomerate but that's probably less likely.

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .
Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 
Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.
Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .
My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .
You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.
TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 
I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .
The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 
We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 
I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 
I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 
Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .
Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.
I also go to Stocktwits for the same .
Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 
But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.
Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",,

EV.V for my fellow Canadians.
ERVFF for my neighbours to the South.
I don‚Äôt want to appear as I am pumping the stock, but I will explain why I got in.
This company has a multi billion dollar boron deposit in Serbia, but it‚Äôs taken more then a decade and they still aren‚Äôt mining.  A litany of issues from the Serbian Government, capital, failed partnerships, a bunch of stuff.  If history is any indication of the future, I should stay miles away.
My best friend has been with them for 10+ years.  Multi buy-ins, multiple losses and a crippling 7 to 1 reverse split that took initial shares of 42 cents to basically nothing.
So why am I investing?  Speculation, which... I guess applies to everything lol.  In December, a LOI involving a company called Temas Resource Corp that could end up in a partnership peaked my interest.  Temas has access to fundraising and capital that could give Erin what it needs and actually take them to production.
That‚Äôs enough ‚Äúpumping‚Äù from me, read up on them if you‚Äôd like, I think there is a potential but I also don‚Äôt know jack shit.  EV is the first (and only) stock I hold and I hope it‚Äôs a wholesome experience.",,

The city it is adjacent to is a coal mining town.  The mine is mostly try but employees so many it‚Äôs kept open more as a ‚Äúcharity‚Äù than anything else.  Those coal miners could easily be employed at the boron mine instead which is certainly cleaner.

The coal mine is kept open because somebody wants it open and has the proper connections for it to stay that way. Another reason why your company is not getting aprovall is because workers will be displaced from the coal mine so it is hurting someone else's interests. Or maybe somebody else wants that boron and has the proper connections to put up obstacles. This is the kind of shitshow foreign investors should expect in eastern europe.

The other two technologies for extraction of colloidal metals and minerals from produced water that I am aware of are both private companies and I can't discuss the little that I know about them due to NDA agreements.  What I can say is that there has been a lot of attention on treating oil field produced water in order to conserve water resources and limit the amount that is sent to reinjection wells, and rightfully so.  The panacea is figuring out how to extract the trace minerals and precious metals from that used frack water.  When it is pumped back up from the ground, it has all kinds of valuable goodies in it, but actually extracting those goodies is a major technical problem.  The University of Wyoming has non-profit (CEPWM) that is trying to coordinate the research of a number of players and technologies that I follow pretty closely.

However my experience is that slowly growing business was mixed and certainly not a killer on earnings during the season, just to mention apple showing something between -5% and -10%.
In contrast fast growing business such as digital turbine (APPS) and Magnite (MGNI) was quite positive on earnings. 
Coming back to pennystocks which are discussed here I think there may be catalysts in the context of earnings. However all the biotech have study results being the catalysts which are not necessarily linked to earnings. All the popular Lithium and Manganese have results from testing drilling etc. as a catalysts which is also not connected to earnings. Therefore I personally do not really care if earnings season is ongoing or not when dealing with these entrepreneur like investments. 
So that‚Äòs just my view, happy to read your experience.",,

Yes, the stock is getting a lot of hype and I see most other comments saying it‚Äôs a pump and dump. The reality is that it‚Äôs purely correlated to crypto prices. After Musk‚Äôs move with the 1.5B, followed by NY Melon bank and MasterCard... you can expect a good number of institutions in the next few months will announce positions in Bitcoin. I personally am still unsure if it‚Äôs a bubble or not but regardless the floodgates have opened and with more incoming institutional money there is a high likelihood it will blow through $50k and test $100k at some point this year. SOS will be flying as long as BTC is flying so just look at it as a momentum play. I got in quite late too - around $5.50, but letting it ride. I would put in a small position and most important thing with these momentum plays is trailing stops - I use a 30% trailing stop loss on these types of picks to limit the downside and try and preserve some gains. 
Long SOS and HIVE strictly because I expect institutional money to come into BTC.",,

If you're telling me that for $30 or $40 I can watch the latest kids crap in the comfort of my own home eating pizza that costs less than movie theatre popcorn instead of paying for two kids and two adults to go sit in a movie theatre only for one of us to get up every 15 minutes to take one to the bathroom or go get refills, you bet your sweet ass I will. Oh, and did I mention that children's movies account for 20% of ticket sales? 
You say that someone is going to dominate in the post pandemic market, and I don't disagree, but why people jump to the amc, the weakest player pre pandemic, as being the one leading the pack coming out of this, I don't know.

Think of this company as rookie in the Major Leagues. They're playing with the big boys but soon, they'll be one of them. I'm a long term hold on this and will double my position when markets open on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, will the number of pot heads also explode?  Nope.  At least it didn't here in Canada when they made it legal.  No line-up at any of the 3 or 4 (or is it 6?) pot stores in my tiny town of 30K people.

In Canada you're limited in each province by how many retail stores you can have. They're just going to hit a certain point where they're at their peak unless they branch out and acquire different companies. Nearly single weed company had a similar run the last month because of news.

What's HITIF's net income or operating income? Has it been consistently increasing YOY? Look at a company like Truelieve and you'll see what a long term investment into a weed stock looks like.
EBITDA is massively flawed for weed stocks... A lot of companies use IFRS vs GAAP for a reason. That's why you see a lot of companies in Canada using IFRS accounting because it benefits them massively, so take anything that has to do with weed using EBITDA with a grain of salt.
Weed companies in Canada can use accounting tricks to look better than they are, again I'm not saying its a bad company to invest in but people are hyping it up to make it seem like it can run up to uplisting levels.",,

The difference between MLFB and an XFL or AFL is that they are not trying to be a competition to the nfl . Their goal is to be a developmental feeder league into the nfl. I can see this having more benefits for survivability compared to just being another outlet of entertainment. Not just to develop players, but also coachs and refs. The nfl is well awarw of mlfb, and if  this is something they like and want to promote it has the ability to be very successful. 
In terms of mlfb failing like all other leagues , u have to keep in mind sports are at a totally different lvl now then even 5 years ago.

The sports landscape has changed drasticly with fantasty sports and betting on almost everything.  Do u know what the NBA D league is? Its essentially triple A for bball, and will pretty much be what mlfb is to the nfl. I know multiple people who watch almost every game of every team of the D league during the summer. Hell when i was dling fantasy bball 2 yrs ago i even watched a few games or had it on as bacground noise many days.  One, because they like bball and just like watching more. 2, because they are betting on the games and have a vested interest in it. And 3,  i know ppl who watch to see prospects and up and coming players , both for betting and fantasy basketball purposes. 
The major difference seperating mlfb and all these other failed or lackluster leagues, is the fact that they will work synergystically with the nfl instead of competing with them. Will it be successful ? That is what we are betting on. If we see a completed and successful season the share price will most likely be around the $0.50 range.

PR will be coming out in a wk or 2.

I've heard that every week since early January or even before lol.
NBA D League (and MiLB) and MLFB aren't comparable as the D League is actually ran by the NBA, whereas the NFL has no need for a minor league when they have college football acting as it's FREE 'feeder league'. 
MLFB cannot possible put a quality product on the field as I read they're planning on paying players $2,500-$3,500 per game... NFL practice squad players earn $8,400 a week for 17 (soon to be 18 I presume) weeks WITH the best healthcare they could ask for. Fringe players aren't going to want to play in the MLFB in the spring and risk getting injured and ruining their chance at the NFL. People don't just want more football, they want good football, and that's where every other league has failed time and time again.",,

I can tell you from the financial numbers he posted he‚Äôs already way off base. At $2.70 per gallon of diesel that is market price for traditional or low grade bio diesel, there is a BIG difference between bio and renewable diesel (one of the big ones being the high water content of bio). Typically renewable diesel will fetch a significant premium. We haven‚Äôt even begun to tap the US market yet, but it looks like he is using that so I‚Äôll try my best to match it up. It looks like renewable diesel fetches about $0.85 per gallon premium there, so that‚Äôs now $3.55 per gallon. Then the US has a tax rebate of another $1 per gallon for renewable diesel, so now we are $4.55 USD. Convert another 30% to get to CDN and we are now about $6 per gallon, or about $1.59 per litre. Renewable diesel prices in western Canada this past month hovered in the $1.60 per litre range so his math breaks down quite nicely once you go the distance!",,

I've been an investor in this company since 2016, slowly acquiring more stock with an average share price of $0.20. I do agree that it is more of a long-term play (2-3 years), but there are some significant potential catalysts for 2021:

Almond-related announcement - nearly all almond growers in the U.S. already utilize bees so adding the BVT ($BEVVF) technology would be pretty seamless, over 1 million acres of almond production are in California where they just got approval
International expansion announcement - Mexico and Switzerland are the furthest along, EU submission will likely come this year
Joint-venture or similar collaboration with a big company - the current CEO of BVT used to work at Bayer, and a potential partnership has been mentioned in previous company calls

Beyond these, there are potential unexpected developments that might make 2021 special for this company.
At ~$40 million market cap, this company is quite a bargain in the current market.",,

Blackbird Plc (BIRD) 
Emerging Technology Company of the year 2020.
Cloud technology which allows remote editing on any browser on low bandwidth, for media and entertainment/sports companies.
It‚Äôs the way forward since Covid especially for sporting events like the Olympics etc.
Will reduce companies carbon footprints as no need to send huge teams to events, so reducing air travel, which in turn reduces costs.
They have signed up the likes of Bloomberg, U.S State Dept, Tata Communications, A+E Networks, Peloton, Gfinity, NHL, Riot Games and many more.
Bloomberg recently said in a presentation Blackbird saves them up to an hour in some of their workflows. They said, ‚Äúthe technology is too good to be true.‚Äù
Stephen Streater who set up company sold his last company Eidos to Larry Ellison of Oracle.
The technology must be good, as John Honeycutt Head of Media and Entertainment at Google Cloud recently joined the board.
The BOD have also got major skin in the game. Stephen Streater owns 18% of the company. The  CEO Ian Mcdonough has bought around 8% since he arrived 3 years ago. Also Gervais Williams of Miton Group owns around 20%, and Schroders 8%.
I see limited downside risk as well, as the CEO bought 2 million shares at 14.02p last April, and the new CFO paid 17.8p in October.
This will be a multi bagger over next few years as the whole industry moves to the Cloud.
Bargain at 19.5p, in my opinion. The likes of Avid Technology are valued at over $1 billion.

DD -
INFO: Latin America's Lithium Triangle (Argentina, Bolivia and Chile) and Peru account for more than half of the world's lithium, and establishing a strong investment climate will be key to boosting the region's lithium production to help meet global demand and address climate change.
Low share float make shorts stay away. (68mil) This company is set to run high with the EV push and Silver squeeze.
$PFFOF Info - 
$PFFOF according just to Price for lithium project is valued at ¬†$0.44-$2.64
*IMPORTANT NOTES FROM THE PAPER\*
- Portofino controls a 2,932 hectare brine project in Catamarca province, Argentina, 15 km southeast of Neo Lithium‚Äôs very high-grade /very low-impurities project. Admittedly, 2,932 ha is not a giant footprint, but it‚Äôs not tiny either.
Portofino‚Äôs property is about the same size, or larger than, land packages held by Argosy Minerals & Lithium South Development Corp., who have market caps of $180M & $30M, respectively. ($0.44-$2.64)  
- Portofino‚Äôs Yergo project is 15 km from Neo Lithium‚Äôs PFS-stage 3Q project, possibly the single best pre-construction lithium brine project in the world.¬†  
- $NTTHF has a $329 million market cap. Neo Lithium is up 818% and price adjusted for $PFFOF 329/68 = $4.83 and we still haven't got into their gold properties!¬†  
$PFFOF offers tremendous upside and is brand new to United States investors because they just recently listed on the OTCQB

The consequences reached deep. David Weild, a former Nasdaq executive, made the case that because speed-obsessed computer traders gravitated to stocks that were heavily traded‚Äîwhich meant they could easily buy and sell them in split seconds‚Äîthey commonly ignored small stocks, which didn‚Äôt trade as often.

The result: Trading in shares of small companies was drying up, and fewer companies were issuing stock in initial public offerings. From 1991 to 2000, an average of 530 companies went public every year in the United States. By the end of the 2000s, the average had dwindled to 126 companies a year, according to Weild. This had helped lead to a broad drop-off in the number of public companies. In 1997, there were about 8,200 public companies. By 2010, there were roughly 4,000. For the broader economy, this was disastrous, cutting off access to public markets for companies that needed cash to grow their businesses and hire more employees. With everyday investors losing faith in the market itself, frightened away by the manic volatility, the brain-twisting complexity, and the rising risk of flash crashes, a crucial cog in the nation‚Äôs economic engine was coming unglued.",,

1) Rising tensions with China. China has restricted the supply of REM in the past for political reasons. They will certainly do so again in the future.
2) The pandemic has brought the fragility of supply chains to the attention of large corporations, policy makers and, most importantly, the military. All semiconductor supply chains rely on REM.

We want more domestic production for national strategy reasons so that China can‚Äôt try to squeeze us, but that‚Äôs not the same as profit. If it was profitable a lot more would be around. 
Commodity markets price on supply and demand, and those with cost advantages win in the long run. This market is tending into oversupply, and non-Chinese firms have cost disadvantage, and will only do well if on government assistance. 
These companies can melt up on hype but the actual economics are abysmal since this desire to have local supplies just means global oversupply and in turn zero or negative prices. But unlike normal commodity markets, firms won‚Äôt shut down, because subsidized in China, and strategic resource in west, so that will prevent the market from becoming balanced and profitable.
Last time this happened big was with low grade solar cells, also via Chinese national industrial policy, then various other governments did it too but to a dramatically lesser extent. This in turn created an innovation vacuum for years because the producers were dumping at (or allegedly below) cost while being highly subsidized so iterative improvements in process didn‚Äôt cause competitive advantage globally. Probably set solar tech back for 5 years or more. Also why so few solar cell manufacturers exist outside China, since even government subsidized western firms have to eventually be profitable. Solyndra?

If you're gonna risk your money in the market right now anyways, why not tie your money up where at least there's a huge upside if the wind blows in your favor.",,

If a team loses a game, that's it, you lose your ALL money. Once the whistle blows or whatever and the game ends. That's it.
With stocks you can hold for a long time and maybe get back your money, you can average down, set stop losses so you only lose maybe 200 out of 1k investment, set take profits once you're in green etc
There are more ways to mitigate risk than with simple sports gambling.

This reads like BS. That rig they show looks similar to some small scale pumping rigs I‚Äôve seen for single well tests, but pretty obviously doesn‚Äôt have any sort of ‚Äúevaporative‚Äù equipment.
What is their market? Treating produced water for reinjection doesn‚Äôt require particularly clean water, just water that won‚Äôt scale and fuck up the well. Is their market supposed to be drinking water? It would be needlessly complicated and expensive. Water for irrigation? This looks way too small scale and most produced waters would be more expensive to treat and clean than seawater. Water for EOR? Again we‚Äôre talking about lots of water, but no need for something cleaner than city water. About the only application that comes to mind where produced water would need to be cleaned to the level of city water might be cleaning up the produced water enough to be used in steam boilers for thermal EOR. 
Now technical stuff. If you want to clean water by evaporating it, you need lots of heat or a fuck ton of area to collect solar. And then you‚Äôll wind up with two water streams, a concentrated waste stream and a ‚Äúclean‚Äù water stream. Most industrial water treatment has moved away from this because its energy intensive and expensive. Most water treatment for produced water focuses on additives to separate out crude oil, descale, and clarify, filters to get rid of precipitates, etc.  For desalination, nanofiltration and membranes are the state of the art. 
Now my disclaimer here is that I don‚Äôt work specifically with water treatment, just an application that frequently calls for water treatment. It‚Äôs a topic that comes up a lot at work. I know the broad strokes even if some of the particulars may be wrong.",,

I‚Äôm an 18 year old with a somewhat disposable income right now, and I‚Äôve always been interested in the stock market. When covid hit I wish I would‚Äôve known a bit more about the market so I could‚Äôve bought in when prices were low, but unfortunately that wasn‚Äôt in the cards for me. I wanted to have a better understanding of how everything worked before I jumped in. I have 2k in a Roth IRA, and 1.3k in a brokerage account, and plan to max my Roth every year, and put money periodically into the brokerage account to fuel current and possible future investments. 
I have been trying my best to stay away from ‚Äúreddit stocks‚Äù or ‚Äúmeme stocks,‚Äù but it is somewhat hard to do since u find some tickets thru most of these subs, and then further research them. My current risk level is pretty high, and the money I have in my brokerage account is money that I have set aside and have emotionally disconnected from - in other words I‚Äôm not depending on keeping this money (although I‚Äôm not looking to lose it either). I have some investments that I feel good about in long term steady growth, and other stocks that I have good feelings about in abundant growth in the near future (semi conductors, small tech companies) as well as a few ETFs in growth/innovation, as well as marijuana, some that just track S&P index. 
What I have been having trouble with is how to vet out which stocks have good growth potential and which do not. Obviously comparing stock charts to past performance is a somewhat good indicator of what the future has in store, but is not always a good indicator of what the future holds for a company. I have looked at occasional balance sheets and income statements, but I know there are other factors to take into account.
As you all are well aware, this sub is not particularly for fostering understanding of investments to young and inexperienced investors, but I have had a great deal of help from this sub and others like it in the past. If anyone has any input on how to allocate my brokerage portfolio for future growth, how to vet out of a stock is worthy of investment and further how much I should invest, and also how to come up with the value of a stock (i.e, is it overvalued/undervalued/what is the actual value), I would greatly appreciate the help! 
Thanks for your time, and I look forward to any responses given.",,

Options have Intrinsic value and Extrinsic value.   The Intrinsic is the value of the underlying stock; Extrinsic value is a function of time decay and implied volatility.  For example,  The longer out your contract is, the more extrinsic value it has!  Although, if the IV of the stock gets crushed or is lowered significantly, it can also lower the extrinsic value, lowering the premium prices.

But I'm also not a pump and dumper, stocks I like, I really believe in I wanna hold them for years - because I believe in that better future und I'm sure that it will come, so are the gains. Sometimes I do cash out anyway, my diamond hands break between 300 and 1000% revenue haha. 
So if you like dead people and suffering: invest in killing machienes. If you like crypto and think this system will come no matter what: invest in crypto or companies trayding with crypto. If you are a vegan and wanna spread the word: look for the next beyond-company (and tell me, I would also invest haha). If you like shiny things and hard metall: check the gold and platinum market.

Those things eliminate 75% easy, and probably more like 95%.
I generally end up seeing these posts are pumping a stock that's all done. Likely by folks that got in late. If the stock had a 2000% run in the last 30 days and is now trending down or sideways, I start researching the next one. This filters out the majority.

IG trading

IG trading is into spread betting and CFDs. They are not regulated by US regulators FINRA and SEC. CFDs are banned in US.
Would recommend you to open account via US regulated stock brokers. Schwab and Webull have been the top choices here with many people . Schwab services international clients and allow OTC stocks and zero stock commissions.
TD Ameritrade and Fidelity also good. Don't know if Fidelity service international clients.
People praise Webull here as well.
I use Tastyworks and they have been excellent.
IBKR, Tradestation and Centerpoint securities are good but they charge stock commissions for international clients.
All the above are US regulated, your money and trading is safe with them.

Do your research what broker suits you best.

Not having enough shares to make the stock worth purchasing. They‚Äôre are different type of reverse splits. The purpose of a reverse split is to raise the PT though. So if you buy a small amount of shares of a penny stock to hold long term, and there‚Äôs a reverse split, you could end up receiving only 1 share of that stock. But it could be a good thing for those with a huge amount of shares. As if the new PT is 9$ and you had over 1m shares, you could earn 90,000$. As that would give you 10,000 shares if they did a 1:1000, reverse split. I don‚Äôt know if my math is right or if the type is right. It‚Äôs just an example. It could be a problem if they dilute the stock further. I had that happen to me with nwarf. It went to 9$ then down to 6$ per share. I had 100 shares, and only had 1 share when they reversed split. Finally sold just to get rid of it.

From what I‚Äôve read the higher the market cap (generally speaking) it‚Äôll have a more stable value increase?

Generally if you open an account with a broker it's regulated by the country you reside in rather than where the company is based.

If you're looking for CFDs IG is a fantastic choice (it's share dealing platform is pretty good too, but not for pennies).
You can't open an international Schwab account unless you have a balance of over $25,000 ruling it out for many.

Market cap is simply a company's value on the market. (Price per share) x (number of shares) = market cap. So if a market cap is low, a company has room to grow. If it is already high, but has met reliable levels of support over a period of time (that is, it has had the chance to drop and has not), it is a more stable investment.
An OTC listing could go 1000% in three weeks, let's say. Now the company is ""valued"" 10x what it was three weeks before. So it will meet with a test of support - will people continue to believe this increase more accurately represents the value of the company? When a stock has passed this test over a period of years, keeps going up, steady gains, then it is a stable investment. Like how big funds are jumping into crypto NOW and they don't even feel like they've missed the boat, for instance...
Volatility is more directly related to the balance of float and volume, not market cap and volume. Float is the number of shares actively passing back and forth in the market. So let's say a company has 30 million shares outstanding, but 10 million are insider-held. The float is 20 million, because 10 million have disappeared from the market. Real examples are more complicated.
Volatility will occur when volume/float is a larger number. Pump and Dump gurus tend to focus on companies with extremely low float, because they can influence the price with only a few thousand people following their ""stock alerts.""",,

I do usually start with screening for volume when I'm looking for new tickers from the ground up.
I follow that with a quick chart check for everything from market cap to the indicators, looking at Moving Average (I use 1 week 50/100), Accum/Dist, RSI, VWAP (google those if you need to, investopedia has you covered)
If this looks tasty, I start looking for catalysts and check the share structure out, and get down to the nitty gritty of financials. 
Some people start with catalysts research and there is merit to that, because if I'm screening for volume as my first step I'm picking up tickers after the catalysts have hit much of the time.
I pattern trade and like to get in and out of a position when it is less speculation, more reaction to literal price play that I can read and ride off the charts. Makes me feel more comfortable.",,

I'd gift my wife a ps5. The rest would land on the bank for a couple months while I plan how to leverage it in order to solve our finances forever, and see how buying house or two would fit in. Rent away, enjoy more money. We're rather low maintenance. I just need a comfy couch, books and my laptop. I'm mostly behind money for the security it provides. End game would be to open a weird store for medieval stuff combined with tables, drinks, rpg books, some boardgames. A nerd paradise where I get to chill, play stuff, and not give a fuck about how profitable it actually is.

I know it doesn't seem like much, but really if you can even scrape together 1k now, at least it will be working for your kids in the mean time.
A mutual fund calculator tells me that $1000 with zero contributions at 12% interest will be $3896 in 12 years. But if you add $20 a month contribution that will be $10500. The total contributions are $2880 but interest earned is $6692. If you instead started with $500 and did $20 a month that would be $8477, enough to help cover food for 4 years of school. Start literally _anything_ now and start earning some free money from interest. This is my biggest regret that I didn't start _something_ when I was younger, even a couple hundred dollars here and there.",,

This is more of a long term play compared to other penny stocks. I don't think this stock is gonna attract a lot of the new people on this sub who wants to make a quick buck. The growth so far has been really smooth and organic and will keep being this way as more good news keeps flowing. Of course if the CEO comes out with an announcement(acquisition) in the coming months this could really send the stock price up.,,

It‚Äôs especially hard when people online post their gains when you‚Äôre down. But -and this is really important- red days will make you better. Learn from your mistakes, analyze what happened (don‚Äôt ignore it) and make adjustments. Sometimes it‚Äôs as simple as the market pulling back, and learning to tolerate that and learning patience is important too. Whatever the cause, it‚Äôs always good to be introspective. No one wins 100% of the time, but there‚Äôs always the future, and you get to keep trying. Plus, red days are, for me, often a reminder to take profits when I‚Äôm up.

Big merger with high wire network:
High Wire is a global provider of managed security, professional services and commercial/industrial electrical solutions delivered exclusively through a channel sales model. High Wire‚Äôs Overwatch managed security platform-as-a-service offers organizations end-to-end protection for networks, data, endpoints and users via multiyear recurring revenue contracts in this fast-growing technology segment. In 2020, a year impacted by the COVID pandemic, High Wire produced more than $18 Million in gross revenue and an operating profit.
They will be going public through a merger with SGSI and will be aiming for NASDAQ. Wait till you hear this: their market cap is only 4 mil, while High Wire Network's revenue is 18 mil during 2020! With the COVID impact! That's insane and with the price of only 0.3873$ I don't see how this could go wrong.
The announcement by the CEO: (can be found on the High Wire Website).
""Merger Enhances Service Offerings With More Than 250 Technical Professionals On Staff
""Spectrum Global Solutions Inc. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúSpectrum‚Äù) (OTCQB: SGSI), a single-source provider of next-generation communications network and professional services to telecommunications and enterprise markets, announces today the Company‚Äôs entry into a definitive agreement of merger (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with High Wire Networks Inc. (‚ÄúHigh Wire‚Äù). ¬†The closing of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions set forth in the Agreement.""
This is also mentioned in the announcement:
""The merger will be accomplished through an exchange of stock and cash.¬† Spectrum intends to file for a name change to High Wire Networks, as it continues to work towards its goal of up-listing to the NASDAQ, subject to satisfaction of the listing qualifications.""",,

And this is pretty shallow DD IMO.
I don't know what Nick's relationship was with ILUS in 2020, but that relationship is likely why he was able to pull FB Technologies (FireBug) into the shell company. Also, not sure why the old company's financial statements from 2010~2013 would have any significance at all here... FB Technologies/FireBug are completely different from the old company.
Looking at these OLD insignificant financial statements from 2017~2019, we can see that total fixed assets were as follows (Converted to USD)
2017: $406,806
2018: $703,468 (73% Y/Y Growth)
2019: $1,659,792 (136% Y/Y Growth)
(Total assets MUCH higher)
All before they were even remotely being recognized like they are today. All they were selling at the time was their MistNozzle and a few limited products (fire extinguishers etc..). Growing a company takes time, that's why OTC can give amazing opportunities like this one to get in on the ground floor.
The sale they made recently to the UN alone was about $100,000, in 1 sale! I'd say the UN seems like a pretty legit customer.  Heck, the company they just acquired does about $3 million annual in revenue, and this will allow FB Tech to lower their production costs while at the same time expanding production of their E-Raptor EV, which wasn't even around during these old financial statements. TVC was also purchased with cash and restricted shares. Looks like they have more cash than we thought!
*Don't forget 1 more acquisition coming this month, and many more coming later this year!*
They are also making the E-Raptor autonomous in combination with new partner Milanion, and are selling modified firetrucks to governments around the UK and Dubai as shown on their Twitter page.
*Any other companies out there producing fully autonomous EV firetrucks with watermist technology?*
If you think this is a scam, you must think $ALPP, $UBER, and $NIO are scams too?
Perhaps their financing company is a scam too?

This is a company you buy because they're changing the world in a significant way, not because of their 2017~2019 revenues. Watch a few videos on their products and you will start to understand how big this is going to be. Of course, to each their own, but I think we are very fortunate to be able to buy at this level. I also started buying $ALPP at $.12~$.16 for the exact same reasons while people were calling it a scam/pump and dump (some laughably still are...).
Currently holding 1.5 million shares, but would love to buy some more at low prices! Plenty of actual scams on the OTC... ILUS is one of the gems.",,

If you've been following the story, you'd know that the company is planning on updating all financial records by the end of the month. All of this information is readily available on their Twitter feed. https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/ILUS/overview has been updating as access is allowed to the new company (2 updates this week). Nick Link has also said that the old numbers will not be impressive. We all know that already. It's the future that we are buying into... Much the same as UBER/ALPP/TSLA/NIO etc...
Firebug alone is not what is driving this stock... ILUS is creating autonomous EV first responder vehicles with Milanion group which are one of a kind. Examples can also be viewed on their Twitter page. Firebug however, will provide amazing technology for these vehicles. 
I'm not really sure which area seems scammy to you? It's the old financials? If so, ALPP is a scam too? Or something about Nick Link himself? He's been working with this company for a looooong time... Here is a presentation he gave in Dubai about the tech years ago...

Actual firefighting equipment would be tangible assets, e.g. physical assets that depreciate over time, and it is just as small as I said. No proof at all of the kind of actual revenue sales being claimed and all the YouTube vids doesn‚Äôt change the fact the claims of sales and actual equipment do not show up in the official financial statements.
Prior financials from Nick‚Äôs companies also show an enormous amount of intangible against tangible and lack of sales. He has no record at success despite these products being promoted for quite some time now.",,

How many tangible assets would you expect a company selling water nozzles and fire extinguishers in the UK to have? 
Are you saying that the new companies being acquired for restricted shares don't expect those restricted shares to be worth quite a bit more than they are worth currently? I'm sure they are more privy to the inner workings of the company and future plans than we are. 
I would say the same about their financiers. In the link I provided before, it states that they did deep DD into FireBug's financials before agreeing to sign a multi-year financing deal with them. A financing deal that was needed to expand the business... 
Again, you aren't investing in ILUS for a 2017~2019 firebug company, much as you wouldn't buy TSNP for their previous company right? TSNP hasn't done much of anything yet and they're already valued at $5 billion. ALPP hasn't done much of anything yet and they're valued at nearly $1 billion.
You're investing in what ILUS will be. And the best thing we can do for now is look at the new partnerships they're making and realize this thing has HUGE potential, and the people they're doing partnerships with know MUCH more than either of us. If you want to buy well established highly profitable companies, I recommend buying Apple and Amazon. If you want a lifechanging opportunity to get in at the ground floor with a company that can remodel Fire Departments with autonomous EV tech, I recommend $ILUS. 
I can't find anything shady about Nick Link's past. He's spent decades growing this business, and it's starting to pay off with huge expansions, recently into India and deals with the United Nations. Joining the EV market with autonomous vehicles is going to send this ballistic.",,

A lot of the downsides mines are currently facing in South America (open-pit, water intensive) and Australia (energy-intensive) can be mitigated by the technique suggested by Vulcan Energy in Europe. Also at a reduced cost (2640‚Ç¨ per ton instead of 5760‚Ç¨ in underground or open-pit mining currently). This is partly put off by a high initial investment though.
However, there are stricter environmental regulations and protests from neighbors to be expected. Keliber Oy from Finland had to postpone their IPO and construction of their mine in 2019 for these reasons.",,

Buy Low Sell High is finding chart pattern of consolidation with good entry at support, buy it. Then sell high when there is spike in activity due to news or volume.

Easiest way to find a sketchy company is to simply find their website.  If they don't have one or a noninformative one then that is bad sign.  Look to find a tab for their management.  If they don't have one that is a bad sign.  Look up a digital footprint of their upper management, i.e. CEO.  If they don't have a footprint of past work then that is a bad sign.  Also, if it is a biotech company (which means A LOT regulations for approvals) find their product and go to clinicaltrial.gov   If they have not done any current research on their lead products then that is a bad sign.

What is a direct listing at Nasdaq? A direct listing allows companies to list on Nasdaq without concurrently raising capital. Typically, a company will list securities on a national securities exchange to provide restricted liquidity to existing shareholders and to raise capital via an Initial Public Offering (IPO).

It happens, in cases like ALPP, that is looking at moving over to the Nasdaq soon - but it is not a regular occurrence.  If it does, it is typically the foreign companies that have established listings in the own country... do OTC over in the US, but eventually move up to Nasdaq or NYSE.  The OTC tiers that mentioned have mostly to do with what disclosure and compliance steps a company is taking.  As you move up each tier, there is an additional set of regulatory requirements that OTC requires the companies meet.",,

So 14 dollars round-trip. Now say you set a limit to sell 100k shares at 1$ and 50k of the shares get sold. You're charged 6.95 for that sell. But if you then cancel that order when you decide to sell the other 50k later on you'll be charged the 6.95 again because it's a separate order. Basically every order of buying and every order of selling it's 6.95. They can add up but to me it's worth it because I like their platform and apps and pretty much anything you want to trade is on there. If you want an alternative fidelity has no fees and almost as good of variety. Just a matter of what you enjoy using and if it's worth it to you.,,

How are you calculating your % held by insiders? When I looked at it, I thought I saw that it was only around 6%.
Are you concerned about their ownership of Merit being diluted with the Bunge partnership? I don't think it's been considered with the analysts' target price.
For anyone looking to jump in, I think we're in for a dull earnings call on Tuesday. The Merit production facility hasn't made its first shipment yet, and I expect the recent flurry of low-attention-span vegan-hype investors will be disappointed with earnings.

I was going with YF numbers.
I'm not really concerned about the Merit dilution, because I think Burcon is in good shape and the patent holder after all. I think it's a good start for Burcon to get deeper into the market. With Merit they can prove how good the product really is and see how the retailmarket reacts. But nothing stops Burcon to produce somewhere else with someone else aswell.
I feel quite bullish about the upcoming business update. Not about the actual numbers, but potential partners and or new patents.
It feels quite weird that Burcon and Merit were both using their social feeds in the last few days (some of them were dormat for years) and pushing good news.
It just feels like something is cooking.",,

It's just wishful thinking for now, but what has me bullish is the Nestl√© cooperation agreement. Nest√© is going in big on vegan in Europe, and make McDonald's veggie burger. Neither Nestl√© or McDonald's have done a significant vegan push in North America. When they do, even if it's not for another couple years, I hope Merit and Burcon are a part of it.

They are hesitant, mostly because of the kind of anti-establishment narratives that come from these outlets.
While I abhor most of those views, there are a significant number of people who hold them, and have basically been conditioned to be afraid of anything coming from 'big pharma.'  I would not be surprised if my parents saw the CEO of Tonix come on newsmax and decided to trust his vaccine by association. Efficacy, safety, etc are secondary concerns, all seen through the lens of trust...
In other words, if TNXP and other companies can curry favor among the newsmax crowd, they might gain a lasting foothold in what might be a new consumer cohort. Just a thought off the top of my head.  100 at $0.82",,

I want to see a gradual rise in the trading volume of a stock, this shows rising interest which is important as trade volumes are the number one factor in price action.  Probably the most important standalone  indicator but of course you never just use one indicator. That's trading suicide. 
Fundamentals
My go to fundamental metrics are:
1) mkt/cap rev ratio 
2) Cash on hand Vs short term debt 
3) quarterly revenue growth rate
4) FCF 
5) EPS beat/loss history
6) % held by insiders and institutions 
7) % shares short of float
8) Number of share outstanding 
All of these relate to determining a companies expansion, solvency, management, and price action
RSI
Typically want to see the 5 day and 1M RSI below 60 before entering 
Double derivative of MACD 
Typically not available on stock screeners, I code this myself. It shows the rate of change of Moving Average convergence/divergence. I cross this with the standard MACD
Catalysts
Browse news articles on various sites, read them thoroughly to see whether it sounds amateurish or like a real companies press releases. Want to see some big news that can be backed up by tangible actions and typically want to see a follow up on that news release for demonstration that it wasn't just unjustified hype. 
Management background check
LinkedIn, Google, hell even Facebook sometimes. A company is only as good as the people who run it, and there's some serious whackjobs out there. 
Analyst Price Targets/Recommendations
Not something I put a lot of weight on but still if there is a consensus by 5+ analysts that a stock is a strong sell then it makes me think twice. 
Sentiments Analysis
Very important in the days of Reddit fueled hype stocks. I use my own Algos and those available online to determine chatter levels, positive/negative sentiments, rate of change in chatter, etc. Let's me know what's being talked about.
Price Action
Many penny stocks follow a similar price action. For some P&D's there's typically a second, smaller run after the first peak if there's still enough momentum left after the dump. I can make a quick swing trade by riding that.
Industry Trends/Political Influence
Top down macroeconomic approach trying to narrow down the industries im going to invest in. Those with alot of chatter and/or political support and/or general population interest. Some examples this year are renewables (solar/wind), 5g telecom, AI, and weed
Some others I use sparingly:
On balance Volume - Averages volume trends and when it flatlines that means the stock is coiled to spring (either up or down). Typically used when volume doesn't have to many spikes as those can throw the indicator out of whack
Parabolic SAR - Rarely when I'm doing day trades on volatile stocks 
Centre of Gravity - Helps me determine entry and exit points. Short term use.",,

Right now : green energy, marijuana, EV, entertainment(once covid restrictions eventually start being lifted you know people are gonna be going crazy to finally get out of the house - and these brick and mortar places will benefit hugely from that).
Then look at standings of the company, profits and liabilities, etc.
Any upcoming news could also be a huge boost(if it's good news) such as great quarterly statement releases, opening new stores or mergers/acquisitions.
I've personally been targeting smaller canadian marijuana companies, they're still a fairly smaller budding market and once legalization happens in the US or even more states legalize there are some of these that will end up pushing into the US market(some already have, along with some other countries markets). A lot of them have seen huge gains over the last 6 months, and wider spread legalization will continue to cause gains as their customer base increases.

 If you want a quick flip just go through here and twitter and see what they are hyping.  Look the price action last several days (are they going up).  Look at volume today over last several days (is it going up).  If so then jump on board.  The disadvantage is you may jump on near the peak and then it dumps and you are screwed.  The advantage is it may continue to take off and you make a lot of money.  Because of this set stop losses.
Look for companies that are growing in nature.  If they grow (revenue) eventually the market will see it SP grows.  It won't explode but will go up over the course of months- year.

Seems like you're investing for the long term, so selling shares right now is only for the sake of buying them again later at a lower price. You can think about it as if you are still investing for the long term, but also shorting the pump at the same time. The amount you sell (doesn't have to be half) should relate to the risk you are taking that you won't be able to buy again for the price you sold, and not to the original amount you put in (for non-tax purposes, that's irrelevant history, what matters is what you have in your hands right now).
Generally speaking, recuperating your initial investment is something you would do if you were swing trading, not as a long term investor. As an investor you either buy it when you think you'll get good (risk adjusted) returns, or sell it if you think you have better use for your capital.",,
