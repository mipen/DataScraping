It only uses the current and past values. A forward backward pass brings in future values.For something like this, there isn't any prediction being done, just classifying past data. Look ahead bias isn't an issue and is actually helpful. To classify the trends well, the lag of the regular moving averages is too significant. Wavelet smoothing is just a little noisier IMO.Separating the data based on a classification is fine and can be used in predictive modeling.The issue isn't necessarily with a forward backward pass of an EMA, it's with any type of model that uses future data, like wavelet smoothing. Wavelet smoothing can still be used in a number of algorithms but has to be used properly.If you were to separate the data and smooth it, or use the already smoothed data separated by label as training data in a predictive model, lookahead bias would be an issue. This is more commonly an issue with wavelet smoothing. See this paper for a review on the common issues with wavelet smoothing:https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuto_Kajita/publication/329443818_Boundary_problem_and_data_leakage_A_caveat_for_wavelet-based_forecasting/links/5c08f085299bf139c742289d/Boundary-problem-and-data-leakage-A-caveat-for-wavelet-based-forecasting.pdf"

Obviously, 10 & 50 are random numbers but I think it conveys the point. As to why use different heuristics to bucket data initially and deploy live algos, probably you could use the first part to generate good entry and exit points which might not be possible if bucketed data using second algo."

If you’re using python this would be straightforward with pandas. Throw your data into a data frame, set the dates as your index, use .loc function to grab only data from Jan 1st onwards, get ranks of the data in descending order (by high or close depending on what you want), check to see if the last rows contain the ranks you expect (eg row n is rank 1, row n-1 is not rank 2, etc), and lastly check to make sure there are no duplicate ranks of 1. At least that’s how I’d approach it to start. If there’s a lot of tickers there may be more computationally efficient ways of doing this but none jump to mind for me atm."

I'd loop through every ticker with your data vendor, find your top 2 prices using the method you're doing, then save them to separate rows in the db (ticker, price, date). Later, when you're querying, you can sort by date and take the top 2.Then, each day at market close (or more frequently if you need it), have an automated process that checks the day's high and compares it to the latest row for that ticker. If today's price is higher and the latest row is from yesterday, update it with today's data, otherwise add a new row.You'd probably also want to check once a week for new tickers, updated tickers, splits, etc. Also wouldn't hurt to double check the week's high against what you have saved.After all that, it might just show you that an expensive API would be worth it lol."

Also, it may be helpful to adjust this factor by including sentiment analysis; however these signals typically track when it's to late to buy, so take the negative there too.  Finally - which is the most important and has the best chance of improving, what I have found empirically is that there are a lot of other python bots on btc already, and many of them are dependent upon a continuously seeding random number for their trades, such they get from the backend of their algo with numpy.random.rand().  You can use this to you advantage to know what they are going to do and do the opposite here too.  I have noticed that this is incredibly effective.  So, to make your algo work far better, take the end result and multiply it by -1*10**9*numpy.random.rand().  This is the number of buys/sells your algo should do each week for the best performance."

In fact, there are many advantages to being a (automated) retail investor/trader. I won't distinguish automation as an advantage or disadvantage because it is simply a tool for executing strategies and not a strategy within itself. First and foremost, small trades (I mean <$100k or so, assuming a liquid enough asset) do not really move markets, allowing your positions to effectively realize the full intended movement at the time of entering the trade. Second, and perhaps more importantly, retail order flow is considered non-toxic and often allows you to get better fills. That's right - market makers DO NOT want to trade against sophisticated institutions and will actively try to avoid their orders. However, retail order flow is literally just considered noise (as for the most part, it is), so market makers love to trade on it (think Robinhood). No matter how sophisticated your strategies might be, your trades will be considered retail and gobbled up by market makers, providing you with better fills. The markets are so complex and there are so many opportunities for everyone involved. To think that I can't do this because someone bigger and smarter already does is defeatist and incorrect. Good strategies make money; bad ones don't - simple as that."

In the long-only case, your winners get bigger relative to your losers over time. As your winners do better and better, your positive returns get compounded exponentially! Meanwhile, your losers just get smaller, mitigating your further losses exponentially! This song-and-dance runs its course and you usually end up doing better than if you had magically had the same weightage throughout the holding period. Basically, a well-diversified portfolio implicitly optimizes itself over time. Pretty cool stuff.Shorting is effectively borrowing cash at a random, hopefully negative, compound interest rate. Even if you lose on your shorts, to make money from them you just need to profit enough on the cash which is initially yielded by the shorts; for example, by investing it long. Be careful though as short positions have the exact opposite effect as described above - your winners get smaller and your losers get bigger! This is why many firms employ a tried-and-true, yet sort of arbitrary, 1.3/0.3 long-short rule in their long-term investing.TL;DR hold longer, use shorting but not too much, find creative ways to chose and rebalance lots of positionsEdit: Disclaimer - I am not a professional investor and have minimal experience in the financial sector.

Let's call our market maker MM for simplicity. At any given time, MM has a bunch of buy and sell limit orders placed on the books of stock X, and these orders are spread apart by $0.01 or so. They may also have some that are deeper, but the bulk will be close or at NBBO. They also will have lots of calls and puts written and/or owned on X but I will ignore that for the purposes of simplicity.MM pays for order flow from brokerage B, and these orders are flagged to them as retail. So, when 1,000s of u/420chadleyjuulmaster's come along and place retail-flagged buy/sell orders on X through B, MM does not feel that their bid-ask is threatened and continues business as usual, making about $0.005 or so per trade (assuming roughly equal amounts of buyers and sellers). Now, let's say mammoth quant hedge fund BridgeShawSigmaTech (BSST) comes along and places a bunch of huuuuge buy orders on X throughout the books. MM may not explicitly know that BSST is associated with the orders at hand, but they have enough data to have a hunch, especially given the sizes and IDs associated with the orders, and of course the fact that they know the orders did not come from B. MM now feels threatened that these order are informed, and that if they do not cancel or modify their current orders, the price of X could increase in a way quickly/violently enough that it will cause them to lose lots of money (i.e. they sold short a bunch of X the moment it crossed their limits, and so fast that they could not keep up to trade out of them, leaving them holding a stinky bag of bad shorts). To avoid this risk, MM either cancels their orders or heavily increases their spread. I like to imagine that since MM knows BSST or a BSST-equivalent wants to buy at near the current price Y (Y - epsilon), the true price is actually Y+1, so MM is effectively losing money by being willing to sell at Y.MM's advantage comes from the fact that they pay for order flow and can basically distinguish between whose retail and whose not (and they also have some of the smartest talent and best technology).This is a huge oversimplification and I am by no means an expert in this field, so I would appreciate any follow up from those who may work in or have better knowledge of the industry."

It’s easy to find those types of coin flips out there, e.g. SPY closes green 55% of the time or so, so you could take a hugely levered position in the morning to simulate a double or nothing bet every single day. I would argue this is a bad strategy, but if you properly size your bets on SPY for example, you can make a good strategy. Bet sizing is actually one of the most important parts of strategy building."

The question is how sideways and how volatile.Think of the risk-return principle; the only reason to invest in a volatile asset over a steady one with the same return is if the volatile asset has greater growth potential. So the theory would say that your profit is a direct result of volatility, which is a direct indication of potential for growth or price increase. And if your returns are consistent, it is probably because you sacrificed growth for safety.So I am wondering if you have compared risk-adjusted return against just a buy-hold strategy for a basket of leveraged ETFs like maybe 35% of 2x leveraged S&P and 65% 2x leveraged bonds or similar."

Good algorithms crash the price in a controlled manner which shakes out paperhands and other algorithms. Poor algorithms are not aware this is happening so they and others may buy the dip, which the good algorithm capitalizes on by doing the exact same thing over again and again until all the steam is taken out. You can see this happen when RSI and wRSI start trending together again, as opposed to one being wildly different than the other. MACD spiking will also trip out algorithms by tricking them into buying or selling.​This can happen at any time, but this tends to happen when big stuff is happening. For instance, the night doge hit a penny I was able to ride with a really good bot and made +50% in a few hours. You only get a few seconds to get in and out for these dips, so you have to be quick and decisive. Unfortunately you have to pay a premium to make moves that quickly, so that cuts into profit margin by a significant amount. A great tip is to have money on the side so you can set a limit buy to catch the dip. That way you only have to time your exit properly and your reentry is typical, which should significantly cut down on the execution speed  premium. This is especially good if you have access to the order book and can see good entries!​This is mainly geared towards crypto markets, but the principles are equivalent. Trading houses don't use those types of algorithms out in the open like you can on crypto markets, it's blatantly abusive trading. Unless someone *really* needs to manipulate the price... If you've been following GME daily price movements and technicals you've seen it in action. The movements can become much more apparent because of the types of algorithms involved (market maker bots that play both sides) and the absurdly low liquidity. Generally speaking, on stock markets there is generally not a situation where a handful of whales are moving  prices and there are so many players all trading at once any one algorithm can't run the table."
