My ideas are my own and I am not a financial advisor. Just want to share my research.
Company: Celsion Corporation (CLSN)
This is a pharma company who is currently in the process of inventing a new treatment for advance ovarian cancel. The treatment is currently going through a phase 2 trial and according to the message provided by the CEO, we should receive data back in regards to this trial as in becomes available.
It is also in the process of making a COVID 19 vaccine and other general vaccines to fight viruses. The recent development derived from this process has the company created a Vaccine Advisory Board with its first 2 members added. I expect more quality members to be added this upcoming weeks. So there will be volatility.  The 2 people who were added are Dr. Glaunsinger and Dr. Yang. These 2 scientists have extensive track records in their fields. Dr. Glaunsinger specializes in virology and currently a professor at UC Berkeley, a top medical school. And Dr. Yang specializes very much the same but has practical experience in bringing vaccines to the market due to his leadership in his previous work at Pfizer. 
The company has millions in cash to further studies so that means they don’t need to
Dilute share holders. That’s a plus sign.
Finally, the company has a patent pending to be approved. Even if the company doesn’t produce the product, it could sell the patent rights to generate cash flow. 
So, the price is at 2.45 and I believe it could rise higher. Institutional buyers are buying this already and options strike price at 2.5 has large volume.  Can we see more than 10$ with this low flow? Maybe but we should keep our eyes on it. Target 10$ PT. Just want to share my research .",,

I was wondering if there's a decent community that is more willing to explain to some stuff to newbies and not so much just have people around to be back holders for p&ds.  With research I have been probably about 1/4-1/8 profitable on a very very very small account. I am just trying to just get my feet wet, and learn some things before I start buying more than two to four shares on something that I think will get a profit.
I'm mainly looking for resources that are relatively reliable and accessible to find what I'm looking for. What kind of things on the chart to look for to show that there is going to be a p&d. I know a number of patterns, but not so much the time frames that are normally seen with such patterns that result in a breakout. Or any great sources for training and teaching that aren't somebody claiming that I'm going to be a millionaire.any help would be a greatly appreciated because I have generally enjoyed the entire process and learning about it but I don't want to lose my ass on everything. Thank you for the help!

Very new to investing and even more new to pennys. I have a few questions, hopefully someone can help me out:

Can OTC stocks be traded at any time? Like for example today, Feb 15, where US Markets are closed, or order won't work just like a regular stock? For my understand they should, as it is some sort of online market and not tied to a location.
How often OTC stock price change is updated? How can you sort of track real time to have some insight of the current price. I feel like I will be blindy buying at last listed price while now it might be much lower.
Some extra info you wanna throw regarding similar issues? 

Thanks!",,

If you're holding it, look at volume.
I personally would not throw more than you can afford to ""lose"" at any one stock if for any reason it went back down to .0001 and stayed there for another 5-10 years. Best case scenario, it goes up and they become current, has news, but don't expect it to stay up. Worst case scenario is you ""lost"" what you put in. Highly recommend taking back you initial investment with a bit of profit and letting the rest ride.

$SOS actually came on my radar a couple days ago before I read the DD. You'll notice that their stock has taken a shit the last couple years, but imo I think this is the inflection point. The catalyst to the uptrend is news of them receiving 5000 BTC/ETH mining rigs https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sos-announces-receipt-5000-pcs-173000783.html. 
Seeing the hype and constant reporting of Bitcoin and the speculation of big players moving into this space, I think this stock has massive room to grow. You'll see that similar companies like RIOT and MARA have boomed already. SOS hasn't had its time yet, imo.

$SOS took a big jump last week, but I think that's just the start. $SOS came on my radar before I read the DD. I hesitated to buy them because I thought they already boomed, but I don't think it has reached its potential yet. You'll notice that their stock has taken a shit the past couple years, but imo I think this is the inflection point. The catalyst to the uptrend is news of them receiving 5000 BTC/ETH mining rigs https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sos-announces-receipt-5000-pcs-173000783.html. 
Seeing the hype and constant reporting of Bitcoin and the speculation of big players moving into this space, I think this stock has massive room to grow. You'll see that similar companies like RIOT and MARA have boomed already. SOS hasn't had its time yet, imo.

Personally I don’t put price targets on stocks and from what I have seen most of those that do are merely picking a number from thin air and are full of shit unless there is some solid DD and fundamental analysis to go with it. As a technical trader I just follow the trend/darvis box/price and vol etc etc etc and set price targets depending on how I am trading via my scorecard.

Why because 99% of penny stock companies don't make out it the big leagues. 
Now, if you were to call pump and dump on 99% of the companies, you would be safe. Cause the price of a penny stock will rise, and the people who were in early will exit making 100-1000% gains short term and invest those gains into companies that will make 10000% gains in long term holds.

There's API limits, rate limiting, and I can 'process' so much data.

I will say that /r/pennystocks is among the most ACTIVE subreddits and so I do see more tickers in my baseline data from /r/pennystocks than say /r/canadianinvesting.

However, a candle chart will show you how the stock is behaving on a day-to-day (or whatever time frame you use) basis. It's more informative.
green candle = the stock closed higher than it opened (e.g. The stock started at $5 at market open and was at $10 when the market closed.)
red candle = the stock closed lower than it opened (e.g. the stock started at $10 at market open and was at $5 when the market closed.)
However, what if the stock started at $5, jumped up to $20, then fell back to $10? A daily line chart won't show you those details. You'll only see that it went up to $10. However, a candle chart will show that spike, which is called the ""wick"" of the candle. 
Seeing where stocks jump and fall to within a day (as well as how many red/green candles there might be over a period) can give you a lot more information on analysing and predicting the stock's behaviour. For example, the fact that the stock jumped to $20 (even though it didn't close there) might mean it's testing a new high, and might go back up to that high over the next few days.
There's a lot more to it than that, so it requires study to get better at using them, but that's the basic overview. It's really worth studying in my opinion. I couldn't go back to line charts since it'd be like trading blind.

I'm not looking for an echo chamber with this post. I don't need more confirmation bias. I'm actually hoping people who disagree with me will post their thoughts here.

My problem with weed stocks isn't the legislation.  It's the commodity nature of the business.
The popular conventional analysis goes: weed is more valuable per ounce than gold -> weed is about to be legalized in the U.S.  -> invest in weed stocks before they take off.
This analysis assumes that the price of weed will remain high when basic supply and demand predicts exactly the opposite.  Marijuana is a plant.  It cannot be patented.  The barriers to entry are low.  Anyone can buy seeds and start a grow op.
All of that points to a traditional ""perfectly competitive"" market where profit margins are tight.  As a consumer, that's a good thing (yay cheap weed).  As an investor, that's a bad thing.",,

Vaping was going to be big. Vape shops started opening up on every corner, websites popping up all over the place. How many vape stores do you see today? How many of those stores and websites are still in business? And this is a product that is legal for anyone over 18 (21 in some states) to buy and use.
MJ is not legal for recreational use yet. Full stop. And I get that reddit is SUPER into marijuana/cannabis/CBD, for a variety of reasons, but just because you use it doesn't make it a good stock. Legalize cannabis will not make drug tests at work disappear. Employers can 100% still fire your ass for testing positive (maybe this will be different from state to state but don't expect employers to suddenly be okay with recreational drug use same as you couldn't blow a positive on an alcohol test and still expect to keep your job).
People are not going to start buying cannabis in droves if it's legal, because they still can't test positive at work. And that seems to be the thing reddit wants to be blind to.

Except that growing quality marijuana is not an easy thing to do.

Relatively speaking, it is.  I don't mean to suggest that anyone can do it and it requires no expertise, but it's easy enough to learn and there is nothing (other than startup capital) stopping anyone from doing it. 
Compare it to a software company - where they have proprietary code that cannot be easily duplicated and customer switching costs are high (once people get used to a platform, it costs time to learn a competitive platform so they're more likely to stick with what they know).  Or, compare to a pharmaceutical company that can patent their product and charge a huge premium into inelastic demand.

The companies with a high end grow setup, liquid capital and a profitable business model will do well once legalization becomes an inevitability.

To the extent there is money to be made in weed, I do agree it is the larger operations that present the better investment opportunity.  The larger operations may be able to achieve scale advantages that reduce their costs and give them a competitive advantage.  I would avoid the penny stocks.",,

Casino isn't a great analogy because a casino designs games that are mathematically determined to be in their advantage against everyone who plays.  
The better casino analogy would be poker, when the participants are competing against each other with various skill levels and stakes.  They don't care who wins or loses, they make money off each hand that is played.  Sometimes the big stack wins, sometimes they don't.  Casino don't care.",,

Did a lot of DD myself over the weekend and your post came as a much needed confirmation to everything good I've found about the company. 
The back to back offerings and trial settlement are great for the future growth of the company and hopefully will have a positive effect on their financial report as well (although it might be a bit too late for that).
I think the biggest short term catalyst is Assertio regaining compliance from the NASDAQ on Monday. It will surely have a positive effect on the share price leading up to that date and more so once it becomes official.

They suffered from bad management and also rejected multiple buyout offers. Many companies like Nano Dimension (ex-pennystock up 1000% since Sept 2020) suffered from the same problem. Similar to ASRT, they bled out from $100 a share to $0.5 in 2020 until they finally revamped the management and released their latest product. The restructuring and change of leadership in Assertio should help them recover the same way Nano Dimensions did. In fact, Assertio has $135mil in annual revenue and their current market cap after the offerings is only $195mil, which shows how undervalued they are right now. I may add this to the post
Edit: On a side note, I am long NNDM and have been buying every offering dip. I will ride it to the moon and beyond.",,

Really showing that someone is interested in the stock. The way I read it is that if it breaks out of that 1.80 range then that would be the stage 1 break level and it would commence its uptrend from there and then I can’t see too much res ahead between that and the 3 dollar range.  Hence why I will look to take a starter position in the stock more than likely on Tuesday brother. Happy trading 🇦🇺🤙,,

CFO (chief financial officier) and finance people in general are number crunchers, they are obsessed with numbers and what the books say. I.e. if laying of 20% of employees would make numbers cooler they'll axe it. In general they aren't innovation focused either. So CFOs don't make companies rocket, rather they tidy up the books, drive efficient organizations etc. Now obviously there would be tons of exceptions, but generally it's not a strategic/daring move for a company.

I bought $300 worth which was a decent amount of money to me at the time. Two weeks later it absolutely TANKED and it was worth no joke, like $30. So I thought “whatever” and figured the only path now was to just hold it and see if it comes back. I closed my trading app and never looked back feeling defeated. Some months, maybe a year later I went across yahoo finance and decided to look at their ticker. They were trading at like $40 a share! I was like “oh hell yeah!!” Ran to the broker to cash out. That’s when I realized they went through two reverse spilts and I now had pretty much zero dollars of it left.

Which API do you use to fetch the data?
I have a few suggestions to improve the stonkbot:
- left align the headings of the table (or at least center them) so they match the data in the cells
- add a short explanation of all the table headings (maybe in the about section) or at least show the whole words in the title or on hover
- add links for each stock in the table to Yahoo Finance and so on, so it is much easier to directly do the DD and view the charts and see some price targets

Right now I'm just scraping data from finviz and I added some more filters in the script, but I want to rewrite it with Yahoo Finance - it will give much more possibilities like EMA etc.
Thank you for your comments! I'm definitely gonna do it this week, since I got some free time.
I've been testing it for about 1.5 week and usually I used the dip after opening. Also it's really important to set stop losses and limits. I prefer to get 5% gain a day than count on 20% and lose everything. With 5% a day after 3 weeks you double your investment and that's enough for me!

Say no more. This scanner tries to minimize this through setting reasonable floating stock setting, but still you have to keep that in mind.
This is the reason why you should do your own DD and not rely on this scanner - it just gives you tips, not 100% reliable stocks. You should do research about every stock that it gives you. Then even if something fucks up, you can go for long term, because after a good DD you'll be sure it will go up!
Also, I highly recommend reading some articles on investopedia - they have really good stuff

Am keeping a few thousand shares in for the event that this is so, because it would be a quick way for it to raise both their profile and $millions to expand their operations without the hassle of going public. 
I don’t see PKGIUS going along with this for 5 months for no reason at all. It wouldn’t take their attorneys that long to figure out what it has taken some daytraders weeks to unveil. 
And to be forthright, none of the information laid out by the OP is news to me. Reverse mergers aren’t all scams, though they’re usually secretive to avoid violations. What Clemons is doing isn’t necessarily pumping up CBBT, but perhaps gving free advertising for a company that has an incredible opportunity to capitalize right now on some high profile clients as an alternative to filing for IPO with the SEC or FINRA.  Using a shell company is the most common way to do this. I still see this thing going up.",,

Sometimes the past of a company is important to look at as it shows what they’ve actually achieved, not just their future plans which rely on speculation.

From other research I've done, the larger private company normally takes like 80 or 85% of the stake in the shell to issue to their own share holders and may further dilute beyond that to raise capital when they initially go public. I would imagine this could be done through a reverse split, followed by issuing new shares, or just increasing the AS and issuing new shares. I'm not an expert on this though.",,

Yeah, I wasn’t trying to disagree with anything you brought up. I went through that rollercoaster of DD a few weeks ago and have made peace with my leftover shares. Cause if it hits all the marks (Alzheimer’s product+acquisition+bonus surprise reverse-merger w/bonus of replacing Clemons with the Pkg staff who all seem pretty damn competent) it’s a fun home run that will make me a few grand.

I am completely new to investing, so I downloaded RH because the UI is simple. 

And...

Currently trying to understand options, and RH says they're not available to me at this time, and I could have a clue less as to why.

RH is actually correct in pumping the brakes on your access to options. I’ve been on RH since 2018 and just got approved for options (why I’m still using the platform), and I’m still reading, watching YT and trying to learn. Thinking about my first options trade on Tuesday, but it’s taken a fair amount of research and understanding to get there.

For the record though, while they allude to doing this, it isn't even one of my big problems with their materials. The point of linking this talk is understanding that the practice of start-ups speaking hyperbolically about AI to trick people into giving them cash isn't unheard of, and on the contrary very common.
From https://sonasoft.com/products/nugene-ai/
Under ""Industry Solutions"" they list Predictive User Intent, Predictive Customer Behavior
and later clarify
Customer Intelligence
NuGene can take your customer data and produce real-time nano-segments from same to empower timely targeting of information to these customers. Nugene can also analyse changes in customer behaviour and predict future potential intent that can be used to create enhanced experience.
edit: Also, just noticed they say ""It takes less than four weeks to determine the best AI solutions out of thousands of possibilities."" So, yea I'd bet my entire portfolio on you're just outsourcing your datascience, and they're using a bunch of buzzwords to grift people into thinking their techniques are proprietary or they have some miracle algorithm. That said, it's not a bad business model, and you're probably going to make money in the short term based on the hype.",,

I can also comment on why I think most of their other use cases and their material in general, is either poor quality or fundamentally flawed. For one thing, while my limited sleuthing can't find a copy of their patent, the topic “Convolutional Hierarchical Temporal Memory Modules” is by no means novel. HTM models are very old, and making them convolutional is a relatively minor tweak, and even previously described eg. https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/hiertcn-www19.pdf https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-cvi.2018.5830 The fact they are touting that as some groundbreaking development should be a clue as to why they're suspect. 
Plus, even if the case I highlighted was the only case (it's not), the fact that it's something they're engaging in should be enough to convince you something is fishy.
They present themselves as having developed a product which can, as you say ""can replace an internal data scientist!"". This isn't possible, for a number of reasons. The best-case situation (and in all likelihood what's really happening) is that really you're paying to outsource your data science to a 3rd party, and they're just speaking hyperbolically about their algorithm to generate hype.
As for google's interest I can only guess, but 1) people are apparently PAYING THEM to take their data and go through it with a fine-tooth comb, I'd imagine Google is very interested in that arrangement, 2) seems their agreement with DEC last year was related to their professional services, e.g data migration, rather than this NuGene. They are quite possibly very good at that.",,

I obviously haven’t dug in too deeply but from a cursory skimming of things it seems that there are a couple differences.
Yselty still provides the only option with flexible dosing, which I see as a big positive. Oriahnn is also twice daily while the other two are once daily. This can play a big role in which medications providers reach to when prescribing, so I think both relugolix will have some advantage here. 
Like I said, I feel that moving forward we will see more medical management of UF and endometriosis. Surgery is still the only treatment with a “strong recommendation” when it comes to management of UF specifically, so the shift will likely take time.",,

We dont even know if they are in a phase trial in the US, there doesnt seem to be a record based on their own website.

I'm not going to discuss the financial aspect right now as CBBT are currently not required by SEC to disclose this. However they have stated following the acquisition they will be providing up to date financial statements of the company which will include PKG.
Now rightly so you mention the cost of drug development being extremely expensive. However first thing to state is the company is not proposing drug development but a medical implant which is many times more cheaper than a typical drug development process.
Also the company has stated after the merger they will seek FDA approval to begin clinical trials hence they have not currently started any clinical trial work.
However the fact they have acquired PKG tells me they are extremely confident of beginning clinical trials and want to be able to manufacture the device on a larger scale in house and PKG must feel the same.
I'm not going to write a lengthy DD article about why I believe this company could grow substantially because ive done my own DD I'm happy with and taken a large stake in the company.

But greedy people kept buying after it had already gone 10x and 20x. Suddenly it's passed its price point, and we have bag holders who paid a premium because they really thought 20x in 5 days wasn't the limit. So now they come back pumping the stock at every opportunity to try and unload some of their bags. 
So now you have a cult of followers split into 3 sections 

people who believe in CLWD long term, after all a stock that goes 20x probably will have some decent catalyst coming up in the future.
people who bought in late and now try and pump the stock to get out.
people who's only DD is reading what the pumpers are writing and buy in.

In the specific case of CLWD, it's settled nicely at 0.12 after rising from 0.005 and likely has some long term potential. But in a lot of other pennys, after the initial rise the stock doesn't even have much going for it, or the pullback is much much higher.

Either it’s complete shit and a pump, or PKG has seen the device believes in the potential of it. 
Are there questions surrounding the acquisition? Yes. 
Should you be worried? Depends on your research. 
Do your own DD.. don’t come here for the next best thing.. take a look at both the positive and negative stuff being said about a company. 
Use this forum as a guide to help you highlight what’s out there. Take a look and the info and then dive deeper and do your own research on the companies you like or are interested in. 
That being said, everyone has an agenda, just like the man posting this as well. 
Take everything with a grain of salt.
Also, my man, why are you mad at promoters anyway? They help us. Ride the pumps and sell into strength. 
Personally, I’m more of a day and swing trader and I do agree with the premise of his post, but I am long on $CBBT and I’m usually not one to hold. 
I’m willing to take the risk. Make calculated, informed decisions. 
Have a plan. Have a price target. Sell at points on the way up. Sell into strength.
Edit: also.... it’d be one thing to call CBBT a pump if it were just them talking about the acquisition, etc...
But you have PKG INC talking and confirming a lot of what CBBT is saying. 
Why would a company that’s been around since 1989, (who is involved in the medical, industrial, government, and aerospace industries... with multiple partnerships) lie and pump this up?

I'm not saying this company is the holy grail but I do see potential and I'm highly interested to see how the company progresses as it is my only ALZHEIMER'S play. 
I think there is a possibility they may have something here. Now there is limited evidence of surgical procedures for the transplant of omentum tissue on to the brain. This is a risky procedure as one can imagine hence lack of a great deal of literature. However there is literature confirming that a decrease in CBF is seen in patients with AD which may lead to death of neurons due to the decrease in ATP production in intraneuronal mitochondria. However with transplant of Omentum this introduces increased CBF which may help counter the above. 
Now on to CBBT, they plan to use the medical device to stimulate the omentum. Now this is where it gets interesting. Typically it is difficult to develop drugs for AD as it is difficult to develop drugs that can effectively cross the BBB. In my company as an example there have been numerous small molecule compounds that have failed to progress to invivo PK studies because of poor MDCK- MDR1 and brain tissue binding data in vitro and not even able to progress to invivo PKs in the discovery phase. 
However stem cells are capable of crossing the BBB and the omentum has the largest supply of stem cells in the body. If this stimulation of omentum can lead to a release of stem cells then this could essentially help protect and regenerate neurons in the brain. This could be why the transplanted omentum studies showed some positive data. Now this is just one possible route as stimulation of the omentum may lead to release of other biologics agents that may also be involved in this process.
Now CBBT will need to perform the clinical feasibility studies to determine how stimulation affects the omentum and secretion of biological agents. 
The amazing possibility with this minimal invasive implant could be a personalized medical approach for each individual to stimulate as necessary to release the optimum amount of biological agents.
These are just my early thoughts and I'm really looking forward to the point at which data can be shared for review in the future.",,

Why would PKG (a company which certainly is trustworthy and generatates 8 figure revenues) confirm the acquisition through numerous social media posts etc if it wasnt going ahead? Why would PKG partner or least attempt to partner with a conclusively fraudulent company despite having access to far more information and lawyers etc that we do not? These are genuine questions i have for people doubting it. 
A mute point but someone also stated the acquisition had been going on since 2018 - a quick google would tell you this was false so I can only assume their intentions were to mislead. 
I admit the company appears shady on surface level and without the PKG acquisition I would turn away from it however with it essentially being confirmed by both parties it seems foolish to write it off",,

Firstly, it is a reverse acquisition so think of it as PKG acquiring CBBT but staying under the CBBT umbrella - the 700k would be more for the months of lawyer fees and costs associated with the incredibly technical acquisition process. There is a whole plethora of information regarding PKG inc. strong financial outlook. 
CBBT as a company would most certainly be able to raise 700k - the limited financial information is somewhat misleading due to being outdated. EMA financial have purchased 70million shares in a direct offering since then for example and I would assume that is not their sole source of income since . Although not a great or accurate indicator, any company able to pay their CEO $200k+ for numerous years does at least have access to some capital.",,

Furthermore, all we have is a letter of intent and posts on their social media pages that this merger is happening. No official 8k filing. Very suspicious that a company would casually announce a merger on social media, but not actually file official merger plans to their shareholders and the SEC. hard to find info about any employees except the CEO, but even with him, it seems that he is paid a nice salary, while there was also a legal proceeding against him in 2016 for not paying an employee correctly, which can be found online.",,

Cannabis was only frowned upon by a small margin of right-wing people  and politicians when it was legalised, there wasn't that many people against it in the more educated population in general. 
Hardcore gambling like single game betting is viewed very differently and highly frowned upon by progressive provinces like Ontario/Quebec/etc — any politician helping to legalize these types of betting would be in a hot seat. 
While it may seem like a logical step from an outsider perspective, Canadian culture is extremely different regarding some vices like guns, booze and gambling. For example, in most provinces, hard liquors are still controlled by the state and you have to go to special controlled stores (and it's even worse in provinces like Ontario where you can't even freely buy wine at the grocery store). Same thing goes for gun control, gambling, etc.

Stocks run up, drop, take a breather, consolidate, then move up again, drop, take a breather, consolidate and so on.  If price swings to the downside make people panic, they probably shouldn't be trading.

Nothing - he can’t seem to get his head around the fact that there is more than one person on social media who doesn’t share his bullish sentiment on CBBT. Claiming that all the bears have “the same sentence structure”, I doubt OP is a linguistic analyst. The truth is that the info online that suggests there’s something off with this company is easy for anyone to pick up, hence why people have tried to mention it amongst all the positive hype. But as soon as anyone brings to light something negative about the company, it is classed as an attack by people like OP. 
This guy is saying that bears don’t have your best interests at heart.

Note - The Q2 projection also does not take into account the new 200MW (800MW capacity) facility due to come online in the next 12 months! 

The letter doesn't exactly say it's due to come online in the next 12 months.  They intend to build it in the next 12 months.  Does that mean it will be online in the next 12 months? 
Also, something else to keep in mind.  Riot is soon to overtake them in power.  I don't know if that's already priced in to Riot's value.  

The newly announced order of 8,000 S19 Pro (TH/s) miners are expected to be received and deployed during the first four months of 2021 and are expected to raise Riot's total operational hash rate capacity to 1.45 EH/s (1,446 PH/s).

From other posts - I believe SOS should be doing around $200-270k per day after the Tesla purchase. It also looks like they’re set to be expanding quite a bit larger in 2021 with X amount of new rigs and mining equipment to be delivered. Sounded like the delivery was pretty reliable might have been even earlier than what they were intending. 
I think all things are looking good. Take this with a grain of salt but I spent a day back and forth trying to comment with some people about this. 
One person was saying it’s all the same guys behind riot, BTBT, sos, etc etc. Be careful with this as these guys apparently are known for burning investors. 
Again I’m not 100% about any of this. Just picked up from other comments.

Thanks again, and for the write up! Best of luck! Remember - don’t go to deep as some of this can be a little iffy as far as getting burned. Only invest in it as play cash if you can lose it. It’s not as foolproof as we think (personal opinion)",,

That's clearly a bike frame that matches the drawing of the Retro ReVolt

I looked up every compay people were saying he destroyed. All of them seem to be moving to Texas within 50 miles of $ALYI. (Except the condom company, unknown resolution) example: 
(USMJ) and PURA (as in NOUV shares dividend PURA) just this month happened to announce they are working on industrial hemp.... in Texas.. 43 miles from Dallas...

PURA recently launched a hemp lifestyle business initiative built around a $1.3 million property purchase in Farmersville, Texas where the company plans to construct multiple hemp centric enterprises to promote the full industrial potential of hemp. 
Toward this end, PURA has already established partnerships with Alkame Holdings, Inc. (USOTC: ALKM) and PAO Group, Inc. (USOTC: PAOG).
USMJ has similarly initiated efforts to refresh the company business plan after the impact to the company's cannabis themed restaurant operations from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Today, PURA and USMJ make their co-development plans public for the first time.  The two companies already share the same majority shareholder, and now plan to construct a strategic and synergistic strategy designed to optimize shareholder value for both companies within the evolving cannabis economic sector.

Check out the 2013 president of USMJ and Ed bollen seems to have an interest in a lot of companies.

On July 21, 2017, the Company acquired Lithium IP Holdings in a transaction that included a management and business direction change. Randell Torno was named the new Alternet Systems Chairman and CEO. Edward Bollen, the President of Lithium IP Holdings, also joined the Altnernet Systems management team. 

 
The KALY extract stuff appears to be in PAOG that's also moving

Last year, PAOG acquired RespRx from Kali-Extracts, Inc. (OTC Pink: KALY). RespRx is a cannabis treatment under development for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) derived from a patented cannabis extraction method - U.S. Patent No. 9,199,960

And it's being sold on  USMJ's site.

I'm hesitant but optimistic they are just bad at messaging and investor relations but that guy is moving all his businesses to Texas with ALYI and they are working on things that support ALYI's goals.
 
What I go back to is the why? Why would a decorated military officer and a CIA officer stop and just start running scams? Why would a filmmaker who understands legacy spend their remaining time ripping people off?
Or are they trying to juggle too many things, solved problems only to find bigger ones and generally went down the startup rabbit hole while promising too much and not updating when it goes by.",,

Much like car chassis. If you look at specific types of motor cycles from different manufacturers, they are all shockingly similar. This is done to reduce the cost of manufacturing.   These are tried and tried designs.  Harley Davidson's electric motor cylce uses a slightly modified standard cruiser bike frame. 
The advantage of developing electric motor cycles should be easier than cars because the opening in the frame is for the gas engine, transmission and other driveline components. Electric motors are a lot smaller and probably needs a gear reduction (multi gear transmission, probably not necessary) and lastly to put the batter down low for lower center of gravity - gives better handling.
All that said, I am not surprised that the frame looks similar. In fact the Instagram pic looks like a very old frame design; probably came from a junk yard motorcycle.  That is not a bad thing as this is a prototype design.  So with very little effort, thay can slap it into another more modern frame. 
Lastly, I've read of a EV bike company that wants to make retro kits for the S. Asian and African market where one can swap out the gas engine for EV + battery.  Find that company and DD that.",,

So part of that decline in share price can be attributed to them ""falling behind"" the rest of the pack.  They have been doing lots to get themselves setup for the longterm (expanding production capacity at Dosecann, bringing Sunens online, bringing Robinsons outdoor grow online) whereas other ""successful"" companies have been making headlines for closing/selling facilities at a fraction of what it costed them.
I myself have in the past exited parts of my position in Auxly to ride the momentum of the bigger players (remember when canopy dropped to $18 cad?!), but that was only temporary as Auxly has the goods and now that they're fully operational I believe managements vision will come to fruition and the share price will better reflect the company's potential.

It's really horrifying when a loss is represented with the same kind of over-dramatic scaling. You log on to see this massive red cliff, you have a heart attack, and while you're blacking out you realize you lost four dollars.

Youtubers leverage websites that make penny stock picks. They take these picks and feed them to their patreons then a day later to their youtube channel. Other youtubers take from other youtubers then you get a massive peak normally from .009 to .8 cents or so in 10 days. Then when the gains start dying some of the patreon followers come on reddit to push for a few more fools to get in at the peak then they take the profits and run. Literally hundreds of penny stocks have followed this pattern starting this year.
​
Youtbers are making 10-50k per month off patreon just stealing picks from websites and then saying 10,000% returns get in fast Elon Musk reccommends it TSLA tied to it the next Amazon bla bla bla. They get their 5x-10x and get out to pump the next big thing that is crap.
Just look at this stock for instance it's literally at it's all time high and basically went straight up. The best move would be a short right now. If someone can post a stock before a 10x increase and before buying millions of shares on here that would be amazing.",,

The company will typically describe its operations (A) and give a financial outlook based on that quarter's/year's report (B).
For example:

For (A), let's look at ALYI. They keep getting pumped for their supposed electric motorcycle, hemp-based components, and cryptocurrency aspect. Here's their latest Quarterly Report (Q3, 2020):
https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/264379/content
Scroll down to the NOTE regarding NATURE OF OPERATIONS:

Alternet Systems Inc.’s (the “Company”) focus has evolved into the digital payments and data analytics, micro
segmentation and marketing intelligence. The target markets include the mass consumer goods, payments, financial
services and telecommunications sectors. Its vision is to be the leading digital commerce solutions provider into global
markets, and its mission is to provide innovative solutions that facilitate and expedite commerce, enriching our partners
and their customers’ experience, and improving efficiency.

You'll notice that there is not a word about motorcycles or hemp and only a non-specific, oblique reference to cryptocurrency ('digital payments'). There's the phrase 'has evolved into' in the only sentence that explains what they actually do. If you look at their financial reports going back to 2016, this entire section is cut-and-pasted, so they've been 'evolving' into their current business for five years. Fishy to say the least, and again, no mention of motorcycles at all, which is odd for a company that is currently taking pre-order information (https://www.revoltmotorbikes.com/preorder-1). MAJOR red flags abound with this company, but this info is only a few clicks away.
(another major red flag in their financial report is their unchanged revenue stream of $60,000 per quarter and their major issuances of stock to settle their debts)

For (B), let's look at SSFT. They've been getting pumped recently and, imo, they sound pretty good on paper and have a professional-looking internet presence.
https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/267475/content
Scrolling down to NOTE 2:

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”). As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss and net cash used in operations of $ 1,118,294 and $768,730 respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Additionally, the Company has a working capital deficit and accumulated deficit of approximately $5.97 million and $26.83 million, respectively, as of Sept. 30, 2020. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of these financial statements. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its debt obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through future issuances of common stock is unknown. The attainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations.

If you are long on SSFT, stuff like this should be a red flag and give you pause.

TL;DR - there is a wealth of information in financial reports and disclosures, particularly down near the bottom (especially if you're averse to numbers or have difficulty understanding them). Many companies will tell you in plain english if they're having difficulties. Also pay attention to what info is left out and be sure to check this info against public hype or news.",,

There’s  an element of truth to signals though. Candles and volume over time can be very informative at a glance when it comes to gauging the ratio of buyers to sellers, thats kinda what they’re made for. TA is a just a dark arts method of gauging sentiment, because the way people really feel about a stock can be seen by what they do with their money, not what they say on boob-tube or interwebs. As long as you evaluate charts within the broader context of the company’s financial situation, potential catalysts, and public and analyst sentiment, can be pretty easy to pick winners if you’re patient enough to wait for the stars to align.

From what I can tell (as of Feb 5, 2021) they only have plans to roll out the infrastructure needed to charge the bikes.  Kenya is set up nicely, with an established electrical grid, but the average income is only about $7k USD ($800k KES) and the bikes are $1,300 USD.  I don't see many people jumping to buy when climate change probably doesn't cross the mind of a VAST majority of citizens living in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Will there also be infrastructure to train and place mechanics in positions to fix these as well?  A lot of great ideas coming from this company, but if there was real profit or long term growth potential in this then GM, Hyundai, Honda, VW, Toyota or others already very popular in in region would have already begun the process.  LOOOOOOOOOONG term hold maybe, but I personally don't see much coming from this.
Edit: overlooked that this is a ride-share idea...wut lol",,

RSI helps you to know if the price is over or under valued. It’s not perfect but it helps me judge entry and exits.
Ownership rates, especially recent acquisitions, can indicate things are gonna move.
Now float is tricky. You need it to be small if you want the stock to move rapidly in price but that cuts both up and down. If they have a good catalyst, like FDA approval or a new item released they can make you a pretty penny.

Basing all of these off of DD found here along with trying to do some of my own, learning what to look for, etc.  I tend to try and find both bullish and bearish for each by searching the ticker on Reddit, Twitter and Google.  Probably a shit strategy but just starting, I'm absorbing things slowly.
I'm dropping $80 each on MSNVF, SSFT and HCANF.  The sub-pennies I'm looking at ($25 each) include GMEV, SIML, PFWIQ and GRST.  Again, no idea that I'll get gains but from everything I've read, I think I can hold them long enough to at least turn a small profit on at least a few of them.
Any suggestions or comments are welcome.  I take it all as a learning experience.
Edit:  I should say as well that when I read DDs here, I tend to look for ones that took real effort.  Not a paragraph someone tossed together in 3 minutes but as an example, MSNVF (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lkpjw7/mrs_canadian_ticker_msnvf_american_ticker_mission/).  Never mind the cool Hogan gif, but there are numbers, data and links that I can go read more on.  I'm struggling with learning technicals but trying to put them together as well.",,

But all in all you seem a little more in touch with this stuff than I am, and there can never be enough emphasis on looking at the filings, whether they be otc filings, sec filings, or sos filings, always important to look at.  In particular, I pay close attention to issued shares, when they were issued, to who, and how much.  Many of these companies seem like giant dilution machines.  Fake news, pump it up, dump it, change name, RS, rinse and repeat.  Gteh is a perfect example of one of those stocks that people here seem to be blind to.

You’ll compare the shares short to the public float. The public float is the number of shares available to the public. And shares short are obviously the shares sold short. (Shares Short/Public Float)x100 is the % short interest. Anything over 20% is considered a pretty high short interest. Another thing is put/call ratio. For example a put/call ratio of .73 would indicate there is .73 puts for each call. Meaning there’s more calls than puts. A put/call of greater than 1 obviously means there’s more puts than calls and means the majority of options traders are betting it’s going to fall.,,

They issue shares to people that lend them money, because they have no  money, so they pay them in shares.  These people then sell their shares  when the price goes up so they can get a good return on their  investment. 

This is not always the case.  More often the company simply dilutes and the money is then given to the lender. The lender doesn't want to deal with trying to trade the stock and doesn't care what the stock price is, they simply want the cash.

2.) When there isn't current information, meaning the company hasn't filed the required regulatory paperwork, which means they are extra high-risk and something someone could possibly make a legit argument of ""you should have protected me from myself and my lack of due diligence by not selling me a stock in a company that isn't legally compliant"".",,

It’s a unprofitable company that has never turned an annual profit as far as I can see. I understand that lithium prices are expected to go up, but still. 
It has already gone up 10x in the past week. That is an insane growth for a company like this. Even if it was  deeply undervalued, is there any more room to grow in the short or even medium term without it turning a profit at least? 

On HITIF, I myself am long at a higher price than you, but as far as I can see it’s both a profitable company and one that is undervalued compared to its competitors (most of whom aren’t profitable).

The risk is the company never finds an R/M candidate. I think this one has particularly low risk given the company stated in its last 10-Q that it is actively looking for a company to merge into and that the company’s officers own 85% of the registered shares...

Cost to go public (IPO) is estimated to be around $750k. Cost to maintain publicly traded company listing status is dependent upon the exchange of which the company is listed (I.e. NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.) but is also not cheap, $10k+ annually for OTC exchange alone.
Also, to clarify, the shell company is acquiring, not the other way around like you stated. 
I’m sure there are other reasons but from my non-lawyer, knowing enough to be dangerous, not giving financial advice, vantage point - what I stated above is directionally correct. 
My advice if you really want to know more - start by reviewing SEC requirements for IPO and maintaining a publicly traded company. 
I’d also encourage you to dig into this companies history (Ecomat) to understand why they are listed and looking for acquisitions given everything I stated above.",,

I’ve watched this stock for 6 months now. It is trading like a stock with a large retail following finally. My opinion is that even low volume days are able disproportionately move the share price. This tells me there are a lot of long term people in this stock. Price got beat up because of toxic financing and that appears to be over now. Seeking Alpha did an article on them approx 6 months ago, maybe longer. Very unusual for them to talk about a penny stock. Their main point, $40 mil sales vs a market cap under $20 mil currently. News is probably 2 months away, guessing, based on their restructuring. I expect sales to be under $40 due to COVID but in my opinion this company will be sitting on an $80 to $100 mil market cap in the future. I love the chart, not much resistance on the way up and with the 20 day sma moving up quickly I’m not seeing a lot of downside risk. All my opinion but I’m more than patient to wait for their future announcements.",,

Idk how Xprize, an incentive which gives money away, though is good for this particular stock. Sure it might gain traction, especially if elon decides to tweet it but idk. Plus he seems busy on posting dogecoin. It's been about about a week and the company has only gone up 10%, so maybe the prize hasn't gained traction yet?? 
On the other hand this company has several mines and is run by Robert Mcewen which is also worth looking into. Could be undervalued imo.
It looks like elon and rob are pretty tight. There's a pic of Robert mcewen and elon in a zero gravity plane. Rob and elon are both known business dudes.
You could make a fair argument that this 100million x prize thing is good for company awareness. Its fairly recent too so I guess we will see where this supposedly gained awareness will take this stock. Haven't looked much into the mines but that's also promising.

ETFM: In my notes I have that the pretext for this rising seems to be that the ticker is changing to FOMO, as well as some other business changes related to that. This has risen more than others I am mentioning, but the 5-day chart shows a steady increase. There might be another price jump before/if it is significantly dumped.
FHBC: At .00307, there is room to grow. There was a small drop Friday, but it may be consolidating at a new base price.
GRSO: Showing a steady rise in recent history. Room for significant percentage increases quickly at .0055. Agricultural company (aerogrow) with weed associations that is still cheap and located in Canada so not affected by US laws. Edit: Though I think it now has more to do with sustainable growing technology than weed in particular.
PPJE: This did see significant gains recently, but I left all in besides my investment because I think there will be another biggish rise based on the chart.
SAML: Very cheap at .0018 and just starting to catch on Friday. This actually appears to be a legitimate company with products frequently mentioned in top-5 articles on products in its sector (smart luggage) on sites like Forbes and Tom's Hardware. They also have an apparel company, where the luggage is also advertised. Problem: a significant reverse stock split is planned, which at best would consolidate 4000 shares to one share. I think this will inevitably be dumped because of that. I only bought 11 cents' worth of shares because I am curious if I will be given a full stock when that is over, as it says if we don't have enough to equal a full share, it will be rounded up to the nearest full share.
SIML: .0036 and more or less holding after an increase. Like some of the others, I feel like this will go up more. My notes mention cannabis connections and partnerships with major, recognizable corporations.
SSFT: Holding steady at about .24, only slightly below the last peak. It may be a chance to buy a dip before another increase.
XMET: After a couple of days of reconciliation, it may make another upwards push. Watch it Tuesday. My notes say, ""New custodianship under David Lazar. Reverse merger suspected, which he has successful experience with apparently.""
Another one that is more expensive than these is NOVN. It has gone up a lot already, though I have been getting consistent gains from it for a while. The DD I read that first drew my attention to it mentioned selling it before completion of a study on March 25th (as the results could be good or bad). I'm also holding this longer than most penny stocks.
Disclosure: I own small amounts of all of these but still have shares because I think there is a fairly good chance for most of them this week.",,

There is no confirmation about FAF having 78 stores besides their own projection last year for reaching that number by end of January 2021 (Maybe they have that information hidden somewhere but they should display it a bit better in that case). But let's even assume that they have 78 stores for the sake of discussion. That is still on a similar level to the 70 of HITI. It's not like their is a level of magnitude between the two. 
All in all, both companies are very similar with HITI having a positive EBITDA for both Q2  (+1.9) and Q3 (+3.96) while FAF has a negative one for Q2 (-0.3) and positive for Q3 (+1.2). Values are in millions of CAD. Let's see what the Q4 results will be.",,

Thank you for sharing. The correlation between social media chatter and positive price action must be quantifiable to some degree. I wish I had the time to dive into it more. Further to your point, I think you can mitigate risk by investing in penny stocks that follow secular trends and have a good amount of chatter associated with their tickers on social media. That's why I am investing heavily in the UAV ($TAKOF, $DFLYF), precious metal segment ($AMYZF, $MNXXF, and $MLLOF) and EV/ESG segment ($CRYBF and $ALYI). Even dark and defunct ""CE"" triple zero wonders are flying these days on rampant speculation. The OTC is really a poppin' place as of late and if you're patient and take proportionate bets, it is not hard to rake in substantial profits here.",,

I prefer the darts or random picker.

They're also looking to uplist into more American exchanges which should get them the exposure they need. oh and bitfarm MC is at 400MM, mara is at 3.6 billion, RIOT 3.3 Billion. 
​
quick maths, in early feb they reported mining on average, 6 bitcoin per day. 6*365*45K= approx 100m gross. since then they've purchased more computing power and raised some equity.....I think ya'll get the picture

Additionally the Fed is continuing the expansion of money supply, which results in a weaker dollar. Weak dollar = high oil prices

Some just don't move a whole lot.  As well, if earnings are within 5 days, there is a good chance that it has already started to move up in anticipation.  Also, in my own opinion (I am a more conservative trader), your potential reward should be at least 2-3 times your potential risk.  So if you are looking at a potential 20% gain, you should only be willing to take 10% loss, 30% gain, 15% loss, etc.  Why?  Because stocks either go up or they go down, and nobody knows which way they will go.  So when your pick goes south, you don't want to lose all of the gains you made last week, or more.
So instead of just picking a random number (20%), use charts to determine potential buy and sell or stop loss price points.  Buy at support, sell at resistance.  If the chart doesn't show a good risk/reward ration, then move on to another one.
Good luck.",,

A 
'DD' at it's core, it simply a deep look into the stock/company, not just a sunshine pump to bring about hype. Most DDs posted here do not include many, or any, potential red flags.
I do appreciate however when someone who posts a DD takes care and time to respond to comments that bring to light red flags or raise questions - and actively participate in a dialogue about said stock. Anyone posting their own DD should hope to get back just as much information as they put in to give to the community, so they can have a fuller picture of where they're putting their money.
Often times though I see people who post DDs that downvote and ridicule posters who comment with questions and concerns. That immediately makes me skeptical that the stock in question is a pump & dump.
I haven't been here long, but the best piece of advice I've come across is simply - the best DD is in the comments. (only after your own personal DD, of course)",,

Secondly, I lost/forgot my account/login - and only made the effort to get back in because a friend of mine who is new to investing started posting and encouraged me to give it another try.
So what would you have me do? Delete my account and start a new one? Go back to keeping my DD / Research / Opinions to myself and my private groups?
I have nothing to gain by posting info gathered through 10 years of full-time investing experience and hundreds of hours of research on this specific stock other than helping people and cultivating some form of community online.

I guess I got a little 'triggered' (LOL) because I keep seeing people saying that about other posts/posters and just feel like the information is what is important - not where it is coming from. 
I always advise people to NOT just listen to me and always verify and do their own research. I literally do not want anyone to do anything based on something I posted (other than investigating further themselves if interested) - I post to share what I am interested in and hear other people's thoughts/opinions too - I don't think anyone can do it all themselves and collectively we will all be more successful sharing/discussing ideas and sharing knowledge - I am really beginning to see the value in this concept.
Also, I've see a ton of inaccurate and even intentionally deceptive posts/posters over the years - and I am firmly against that - part of my motivation of posting is to combat that to help/protect newer investors.
This becomes a catch 22 though because if I post something negative about a trending stock, regardless of how true, people who are long/pumping that stock tend to attack me like an angry mob. But I guess I'm happy to take some punches if it means exposing information which may save some people from losing their shirts.
Anyways - I'm always happy to chat and help point you in the direction of any information you are looking for. I by no means have all the answers - but I usually know where to find them!

If you look at their financials, you will see that they do not yet generate any revenue:
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABEPF/financials?p=ABEPF
Further, from their financial statement, periods ending November 2019 and 2020 (https://visionlithium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EF-2020-11-30-Final-An-2021-01-25.pdf), under their Notes section:

The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption, meaning the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations.
Given that the Company has not yet determined whether its mineral properties contain mineral deposits that are economically
recoverable, the Company has not yet generated income nor cash flows from its operations. As at November 30, 2020 the
Company has a cumulated deficit of $38,257,632 ($38,086,617 as at August 31, 2020). These material uncertainties cast
significant doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional financing to further
explore its mineral properties and continued support of suppliers and creditors. Even if the Company has been successful in
the past in doing so, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in the future.

The whole thing is worth reading, but I've excerpted and bolded some important points.
Bottom line: this company is fully dependent on whether or not their exploration projects yield minerals that are economically feasible to extract. I think any money you invest in them would be purely speculative, unless they release some positive news.",,

-Albermarle's waste brine water will have high concentrations of Na and Ca (since they removed most of the Li). These inhibit Li processing.
-Advances in direct lithium extraction (DLE) will improve the ability to capture Li from brine, even at lower ppm (<1,000 ppm). This will make brine extraction even more attractive. Albermarle paused their Silver Peak production in 2020 due to the reduced demand in Li. They're ramping back up, and likely putting that new money into DLE. If they push up their brine production, they're less likely to try and work with claystone.
-Claystone Li extraction is a newer method. There are a couple companies looking to open up claystone operations in the US. From what I've read, the type of claystone heavily affects Li extraction (is the Li in-between the clay layers, or stuck in the clay layers). Developing new technology is tougher than refining current technology (DLE). How is their technique working? They haven't said.
I wrote a bit about the Clayton Valley in this post, give her a read.

What I find interesting (and didn’t get into in the original post) is that cypress has only explored something like 1/2 of their property. They stopped drilling early because they found so much lithium they already could feasibly estimate a resource that would produce the 27,000tpy LCE for 40+ years. But in one of those Don Mosher vids I dumped at the end, he clearly talks about how any company could easily come in and build out twice the size of the operation. Bill explains in the crux interview that this operation can be scaled linearly up or down to either half production or double it. Ie. if you want a mine that does 13,500tpy LCE instead of 27,000tpy, you only need to front 50% of the capital. Likewise, you could probably operate a 54,000tpy operation if you had twice the cash to build the mine. You might say, yeah but how can you assume there is Li? Well other early stage companies currently drilling around cypress’s property limit have also been finding lithium, meaning the deposits may stretch the entire extent of the property. Some are speculating that cypress raised more money than needed in the recent financing so they could also do additional drilling concurrently to the pilot plant construction so when they write the DFS they can actually increase the resource estimate size to truly show how much potential this site has. Really interesting stuff!",,

it is my understanding that if we were to use Albermarle brine, it would be the actual brine from the ground, not wastewater. If anything the lithium in the brine will probably increase lithium output
I personally don’t have experience with DLE so I’ll have to look into this more. But cypress’s operation is proposing 27,000tpy LCE (which is probably an understatement), not sure if DLE is able to match that with Silver Peak currently producing 5,000tpy LCE. 
they have said their technique works, they just haven’t proven it on a larger scale - that’s why they’re building a pilot plant. Here is what was written in their press release on May 19, 2020, “NORAM Engineering and Constructors Ltd. and CMS designed and tested the flowsheet for recovering the lithium from solution. Testing was completed in March 2020 and report received on May 14, 2020.

The price jump happens without any news. If a miner just announced they found lots of mineral deposits, or a pharma company just got some approval/results for their drug - the jump is justified. People are pumped on actual news, not on fake tweets.
There are scam companies that pump their own stock. The operation is a bit different. Easiest one to spot lately is $VPER (Viper Networks): take a look at their website (fake product), their twitter account (promises and hype), and their chart (notice the weird volume spike on Jan 21 without a change in price). Also, why would solar panels need 5G technology???

One basic thing you can do is lookup a ticker on https://www.otcmarkets.com/. If you see a STOP sign, that company is dead.

Thanks again for posting this. I started following the basic outline you put out here three weeks ago and tweaked a few things (there are certain sectors like pharma and oil/gas that I generally avoid) and found some real winners like KOPN, INPX, TAIT, DNN, and XPL that I got 20-80% returns on in a few weeks (set up a stop loss on TAIT and got out in time). Couple of duds (PPSI, though I plan to hold this for at least another month to see), but overall, great success. Thanks again.",,

I learned my lesson, if you're going in, you go in low. Find stocks that seem to have something going for them also. Usually all stocks have a P n D moment, but if it holds at a certain price, it means that people are believing in the stock long term. Another tip, and this is mainly luck, is if you see it dump hard, it doesn't mean it's a failed stock. It's usually people trying to drop the price or early investors, taking profits. Always do your DD, always see news of your stocks. Let's say a stock you invested goes bankrupt, if you read the news on time you can take out profits. READ READ READ. Also, never sell your total stocks, sell maybe 80% and let the rest ride, maybe that stock goes up further and you won't regret it as much. Some people will try to influence your mind, before you leave a stock, make sure many others have a similar opinion. Don't let 1 person decide for you.",,

The key is not to buy to late in the rocket up. 
What happens is the stock becomes over vallued very quickly.. it's usually pretty easy to tell when that happens DONT BUY but if your holding... You'll likely want to do some profit takeing as so many other people will to. Then it will drop back down but usually higher then where it was before the pump. Depending on the catalyst of the pump it may be worth getting back in or not.
Check out BES.V or LTE it just happened in massive way.
Lots of bag holders there but the price hasn't moved back down. If you just go from penny stock to penny stock you'll notice most look like pump and dumps in the last 6months except many of them are now worth over 1$. 
If you see the pump.. wait for the initial profit taking to be over.. then evaluate.

I do not own DNN, but to me it looks like its increase is based on several pieces of recent news. I think it will always be the case that people find this news first, take advantage of it by buying, and then rely on that good news to get an increase, even by spreading it themselves. That means even real good news and hype can lead to a similar result as a pump and dump. I think a lot of that happened some years ago with weed stocks based on the charts I see (and what I think is happening with them again). If you still have it by the end of this month, you may want to sell because it looks like an earnings report may be released March 3rd. So I would think about short-term profits on this one. If you have a decent increase, take it because there will likely be a dip and volatility from the earnings report. I am new to this, but that is how I would play that.

There's another guy who tracks his performance and it's pretty good.
What you shouldn't do is buy immediately after his alerts (unless you can enter within seconds) because the price will get pumped by his followers buying in. Usually it drops down again to the previous level within a few days at most. Sometimes it stays elevated.
The point though is to hold for a couple weeks/months so certain catalysts can take place that should catapult the stock higher. It's not meant as a an immediate gain. I follow his plays every now and then and I made decent money off it.",,

Since the price is slightly downwards to stagnant currently (I hope just reconciling a bit from a slightly sharp but overall small leap), I am planning to try to lower my cost basis by buying at somewhere near the low of the last couple of trading days, which would give me more room to feel comfortable holding. After I try that Tuesday, I will probably post about it here to get opinions.
I should also say that I am only just starting, so I am trying to build up from earnings rather than dump my own money into penny stocks. Therefore my investment in this is almost pointless.

Again bro can you read? I'm not talking about this month. I'm talking about the initial run up from when it was .50 cents in December. I'm talking about the three days where it went from .50 cents to $2. That would have fit his criteria
​
And the catalyst that came was a research paper done by BNGO itself that wasn't peer reviewed and ARK investments Simon stood by PACB. Long before the Genomics conference in January where they had an opportunity to explain. So because it was dead in the water for months, had a catalyst that was shakey at best from a company on the verge of bankruptcy, and had effing ARK telling the public it wasn't a big deal, the only thing I feel like would have saved the investor from selling was doing his DD and knowing that this was big shit.
​
And thats why when it went from .50 to 1.10 I didn't sell, I bought more. I bought more at 3 - 4.20  and even $10. But the initial push would have met this criteria for a pump and dump and I would have been one of those sad users selling at $2 if I listened to this advice.
lol didn't do the DD. Thanks for the laugh. My point is, thank you OP for explaining in laymen's terms what a pump and dump is, but if you're doing your DD thats literally all that matters, and I'm really just tired of people complaining about the pump and dumps on here as if they can't think for themselves. Let them lose their money if they can't read SEC filings and are going to trust strangers on the interwebz.
​
And as for not doing the DD, your comments clearly show you're making assumptions. You clearly either are one of the influx of new investors or just completely missed the boat if you don't remember the first few days of that mess, and then holding through the subsequent offerings that came two weeks in a row.",,

As a side note, never invest in a CRISPR stock that’s going for gene therapy, it is a fundamentally flawed technology that creates unwanted off-target deletions. Even though those unwanted deletions are rare, they are significant and basically prevent a good clinical outcome. AGTC is not using CRISPR, so it has at least a decent chance of working.
As a stock pick, AGTC could do okay, even great if they have good early results. However, their technology misses the mark.",,

Yes, you can get around the day trade issue this way, but then you have new issues to sort out. 
There’s a difference between a margin account and trading with margin. Most accounts are margin accounts. Features that come with this are varied.
The biggest thing with a margin account is that you don’t have to wait for funds to settle after selling a stock and you can use those funds immediately to buy something else. Meaning that if you sell $100 worth of AAA stock, you can use that money immediately to purchase $100 worth of BBB stock if you have a margin account. If you have a cash account, you have to wait a number of days for those funds from selling AAA stock to settle. This means that with a cash account there can be delays in trading while waiting for funds to settle, unless you have a lot of cash to play with. 
My point is that you lose certain features by downgrading to a cash account, beyond the ability to trade with margin. I don’t trade with margin but I have a margin account. Most people have a margin account, even if they don’t know they do.",,

Of course different brokers vary, but quickly looking at Robinhood it seems that you need to wait for funds to settle when using a cash account.
“If you have a Robinhood Instant or Robinhood Gold account (both margin accounts), you have instant access to funds from bank deposits and proceeds from stock transactions. This means that if you sell a stock today, you can use the funds right away, instead of waiting the typical two trading days for access to those funds.”
And also, “A Robinhood Cash account allows you to place commission-free trades during the standard and extended-hours trading sessions. You won’t have access to instant deposits or instant settlements. You can downgrade to a Cash account from an Instant or Gold account at anytime.”
This makes sense to me because if you are using cash only then you should not be able to access instant settlements, as the proceeds from stock transactions don’t settle instantly. So in theory you shouldn’t have access to them before those funds are truly available.",,

Our government has never designed, implemented, or executed an optimal strategy, policy, or legal framework in the history of this nation.  Nothing will ever be implemented perfectly, and nothing will ever be written in such a manner as to be to the benefit of the people.

I have the funding they received for their solar farm in Mexico as well.

Can you share? The last 10Q in November says they are searching for a funding partner.

The partnership continues to seek financing terms for the project with SEDI building and developing the Durango Mexico Solar Farm Project. The proposed project funding would be for up to $70+- million in capital to build a 50+ plus megawatt solar farm in which NMG and SEDI would each own an equity interest, respectively in the completed project, with the financing partners owning the remainder of the equity in the project holding company. 

I mentioned elsewhere that I did not believe this to be a slam dunk yet because the latest was they were seeking financing terms. If you have newer information, that would be huge.",,

A more realistic price for the offering will be $0.0090 which is a 25% discount and quite common with new offerings. 
If everyone panic sells then the price will tank and we’ll have to wait until the next catalyst (increase of ownership in bud cars or quarterly earnings report) to see a rise above $0.01 again.

M1 includes funds that are readily accessible for spending. M1 consists of: (1) currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions; (2) traveler's checks of nonbank issuers; (3) demand deposits; and (4) other checkable deposits (OCDs), which consist primarily of negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts at depository institutions and credit union share draft accounts. Seasonally adjusted M1 is calculated by summing currency, traveler's checks, demand deposits, and OCDs, each seasonally adjusted separately.

Playing on volatility and with patterns that bounce and dip a lot either daily or weekly,  you can more than often get up over 2.5% at some point , so you also put your limit at 2.5% get out repeat. 
You cant score 400 times in a row and I dont know why not scoring every move in a row is a problem.  if you win more than you lose and have a good overall growth, and  with calculated risks it looks doable. It requires to follow good infos constantly and you need to always be aware of stocks that will move, but these infos are kind of accessible with all the subs streamers and medias. You can go higher on some good plays and still set a 2.5% stoploss to protect if it goes down but when it goes up and you are up more than 2.5% take your limit sell at whatever % you are currently up and secure it , from there repeat if goes up and get out if its to go down. With the crazy markets right now you could do it multiple times a day with stocks that trade a lot and have the good patterns.
You need to get on the news and trending stocks , they fluctuate more. Right now buying puts on stocks that go mainstream looks and buying them back then selling them back again can give good results. Not sure how long this will last and I have yet to try it but if I had the time to invest into it im pretty confident it would work in this bull market. And after just going back to swing. 
Havent most of your stocks all been green by 2.5% at some point? Maybe I have been lucky but there are many stocks who just get down early and stabilize,  or the opposite. 
I dont want to make it sound like its instant money with no losses and all but I like the idea. If I was good at programming and calculating a bit more id do some macros to automate some moves like that. 
Why you think such a strategy would be that bad? And not talking about wanting to aim a perfect 400 trade run im confident not stupid. Well that stupid.",,

Its a natural balance of probability of profit and max stop loss right. The larger your stop loss the more often you make profit, and vice versa.
I'm not saying you can't make money on stocks. Ofc I've had stocks in the green.  My initial comment was vs ""It would only take 467 trades to turn 10 dollars to 1million"". That's just a misleading statement imo, with the ""just"". 467 trades of profit in a row is not easy in any form. And if you start losing basically any non-zero probability of the time, the trade count goes skyrocketing. Nowhere did I say its impossible to make 1 mil from $10, there are various ways to that (e.g. putting 10 buck into btc when it was worth cents).",,

The fact is that a lot of your trades will fail, especially if you are trying to day trade, but the point is to minimize risk and find stocks that are just about to explode. I used to have no idea on how to go about doing this, but just last week I found BRQS, NOVN and GSAT that all three gave me big gains, and there were indicators early on showing it would. When the volume starts to come in, then it's time to get out the charts, watch how it reacts to vwap and which way RSI is showing. That is how I have learned how to day trade with some success. I've also watched a lot of DFV's YouTube videos and I'm trying to be more patient and look at the bigger pictures now with companies. Lately I've been selling off my cost or taking a little bit of initial profit on a spike and letting the rest of the shares run into the foreseeable future until I see another good buying opportunity.",,

It almost looks like they are transitioning into a R&D company with government funding but the schedule written in the article says something about ""third-party equity coming in"" and the project is now moving into Phase 2. 
…..AND I'm dumb. The article is from Feb 11 and the price jump was on Feb 12.

This must have taken a lot of time and was very educational, particularly on how dilution works.
I have one question about dilution that you may know the answer to. Are there any rules for OTC stocks about when they can dilute other than that the shares have to be authorized?
I've seen people in various places claiming that a company couldn't be diluting for x reason although dilution was in fact happening. I never really believed them as it seems like dark defunct companies can pretty much do whatever they want, but always wondered if there was anything that could stop them.
EDIT: I wanted to add one thing that you didn't talk about. IMO, speculation is more important than anything else in penny stocks, particularly OTC ones as little information is available.",,

When I say the word dilution, I specifically mean the leadership of the company issuing new shares to be sold on the market to raise money.
A company who is doing that will need to file paperwork to that effect, which makes it obvious what they are doing. The reporting requirements might differ between the OTC variations.
The convertible instruments I described above, however, (convertible notes, convertible preferred shares, and also one I did not mention warrants) are all sources of new shares that are not new dilution because they've already been recorded on the balance sheet. Since they were already there on the balance sheet, the company does not need to file any paperwork when these new shares appear. However, you will be able to find information about convertible instruments converting in the following 10-Q/10-K.
So the Outstanding Share count rising does not actually mean ""dilution"" is occurring as far as new dilutive action is concerned-- it can simply mean that old dilutive action is resolving itself into shares.
In a more specific accounting sense, ""dilution"" is adding new equity to Shareholder's Equity that you will balance with the Cash that you raise when you sell them.  Conversions of convertible notes, preferred shares, or warrants, is simply the redistribution of numbers from the ""liabilities"" section of the balance sheet to the ""shareholder's equity"" section. (Or from one ""shareholder's equity"" subsection to another).",,

So, just as an example, I'm looking at the filings for PLYZ (not trying to pick on any stock, but I know this one has diluted a lot). The most recent 10-Q (04/06/2020) shows only 300 mil authorized shares and I looked through later filings and can't find where they increased the authorized share count. Additionally, I can't figure out where this many extra shares would have come from based on the number of warrants, convertible debt, etc. They now have 25.5 bil AS and 16.3 bil OS. Apparently the float is only 46 mil (it doesn't really seem believable, but that's what OTC markets says. I think they may have missed a couple zeros).
Could you show me in the filings where it would have allowed them to add this many shares? I would really like to better understand these filings.",,

April 2020 was a long time ago for their last 10-Q, and they filed a notice that their 10-K would be late all the way back in August, and then they never followed up.
OTC Pink isn't super regulated, so they probably won't get in any trouble for doing all this, as long as they had board approval etc. for everything they did (which I'm going to assume they do).",,

That was basically my original question. I wasn't really talking about current reporting companies, but delinquent ones. I've seen people make arguments on message boards saying that these companies couldn't report for 1 BS reason or another, but you just confirmed what I already believed.

The 42-44 minutes mark is where numbers are discussed and a bit of BLPG gets thrown in. 
Hypur runs the compliance and payments for big banks to accept pot money. The cash side...”well, I own the armored truck service (BLPG)...”. Mentioned BLPG being public, then gently steers the conversation away after hinting at big plans. Interviewer says “it goes hand in glove with the payment services? (Hypur)” to which Mr Galvin agrees. 
This is exactly what those of us following BLPG for the last few years have been waiting on and expecting. They are clearly connected at the hip, but one is public and one is private. At current levels...low risk, high reward",,

Fb and Google are even attacking Apple now that Steve Jobs isn't around to create a defensive PR campaign. Siri is constantly attacked, as is Bixby for not data mining you as their sole purpose like Google so Google assistant seems ""better"" because it data mines the hell out of you while siri and Bixby can't do that and are only meant to be functional voice control interfaces. 
the attempts by Apple to further protect their users even caused them to be sued by fb which is ridiculously brazen being as zuch himself had to testify about how Facebook and their shadow profiles were what was used to divide the people and target them with radicalising media. 
I remember when YouTube was so cool before google bought it and destroyed it. it was such a vibrant community that could have been an actually grounds to lead to world peace.
I ran a YouTube channel and podcast and on you you've you could do video responses which allowed the audience to get exposed to a broad range of perspectives.
they killed that immediately and started diverting the demographics and feeding them each different content streams.
we did a general news show with a progressive tale back America from the local level angle and did a lot of deep dives into censored eras in history like how we got from a time when I love Lucy was America's favorite show, a show about a white woman married to a Hispanic immigrant with a funny accent who even had ehag would later be referred to as a ""miscegenation"" aka a mixed race baby.
there were all these pre code movies and stories from coast to coast of his progressive we were before the eugenics era swept the nation.
we had about 50000 subs, then after the switch suddenly our market went from a normal distribution to way disproportionately black. Obviously it wasn't that black people just suddenly all liked us way more than everyone else but we were talking about issues that if white people knew, they'd realize that the white supremacists movement was a con job and segregation was forced upon all of us.
meanwhile the other libertarian slanted channels who were more rand types I. e. corporate worship, and big business can do no wrong, and 1776 was a mistake, we should go back to being a series of banana republic types randomly got mixed with the  ""racial realism"" movement.
meanwhile our channel was linked to more black consciousness and even black Israelite type channels I'm guessing because one of us was a POC, since I don't imagine they literally listened to our content and realized we weren't racist.
our base was still really cool but it got really creepy how radicalising it became where we'd have callers who were literally pushing for armed revolution as our channel got pushed more and more toward groups like the revolutionary communist party etc.
meanwhile Stephen Molyneux and others like him were linked to more and more Ayn rand style anti government, and a new form of ""rational racism"" with channels that would say stuff like ""Africans don't have lower IQs, on aggregate they have a median IQ that is average just like whites, the only difference noted is that whites have a wider range of variance so whites can be dumber but whites can also be geniuses which is why white people invented everything.
I'm not exaggerating at all just paraphrasing, it got that absurd. that was about 12 years ago and it's horrifying seeing how well the segregation worked to the point where once the groups were so segregated they could be weaponised which is how we got Qultists, white supremacists and radical Christians somehow shoulder to shoulder as if that grouping just naturally happened.
For a while I started doing writing and it was horrifying even back then realizing that after YouTube was purchased by Google all ""news"" and infomedia in general was completely reliant on 2 sources who directly fed more and more radicalising views to further segregate the demographics.
it's like a TV with 2 channels except every group got a different set of ads targeted specifically to convince them to be further radicalized.
we ended up doing a deep dive into why and who was sponsoring this and covered exactly what was happening. it's sad and creepy going back and listening to ourselves a while living in the world we predicted would be the consequence of what they were doing.
fb and Google need to stop pretending their algorithms are just ""defective"" and be charged with at least negligence but with the info we have they are more than guilty of treason. Tay was only meant to be a test of how easily they could manipulate a naive internet user.",,

Small companies or start ups have one thing in common: The company was built up but whatever they were doing is not working out for their growth. Note that this is not the case for companies that are just new and growing, but rather those that chose a path and can't penetrate the market or became dormant. Becoming dormant as a small company is actually not that uncommon, if you have a customer that wants your product and pays more than you spend on employees etc., then you are totally fine to keep going if you don't plan on expanding.
To change your entire setup/work field all it requires is for such companies just a lucrative new field coming up where software or similar you already use either way also fits. That is made even easier because their IT infrastructure (licenses, servers etc.) is usually minimal and allows to swap. Compare that to a huge company and watch it burn when a major server update happens, main reason why COBOL still exists.
So to get back, anything that might be an easy or upcoming entry those companies have the best time out of all. The change is minimal while the potential is in theory unlimited if they manage to get a foot in. And yet again, while for a big company this is a huge announcement and risk to go over to a new market, for a small one it's barely any risk or announcement. This happens all the time. Cannabis just has gotten way more attention than most other changes in the past.",,

Too often this place is an echo chamber. Thank you for bringing this up. 
1). From my understanding this approval has been years in the making. The FDA is postponing PDUFAs for best standard of care drugs right now, some life changing. I hate to say it but selling OTC hearing aids isn’t their highest priority right now. The FDA is busier than they’ve probably ever been and have publicly said they are spread too thin. Take this into consideration. The bill has been approved it’s just a matter of time IMO
2) definitely concerning, but not as concerning if they don’t follow through with getting current. It’s definitely something to keep an eye on. If they miss their targets for getting current that’s a massive red flag for me. 
3) you must have not looked too hard because it’s listed on Walmart’s website. Valid concern over Amazon. The Bose hearing aid has potential as well but that article is a year old. A lot changes in a year. Definitely something to keep an eye on. I’m sure all the other competitors will be gearing up competition for them as well. 
Great DD though. I really appreciate your insight.",,

He knows this. Untrue claims and the way he's interacting with investors, it would be a home run against him if it was indeed a P&D.
Otc hearing aids now allowed is actually a good opportunity for him, i don't see why he would throw it all away to end up in jail or having to pay back his investors. Sure there were some things in the past that went wrong, but with covid hitting, he's not the only one that lost investor confidence because he couldn't keep things moving forward.
Also, his father losing his license was for reasons related to the customers (upselling), not for a P&D scam.
Now, with that said... Im not 100% sure he's got what it takes with so little personnel to keep the operation running smoothly. If things go well at first and he doesn't know how to run the company, there might be a gradual decline back to pennies or even subpennies...",,

So whatever price they adjust their offering, share diluting will stop after they reach $4.5million.

If you find something that has decent DD, it's not a brand new account, and isn't spammed all over reddit, then it's a possibility. From there check out Stocktwits to see what people are saying, go on OTCMarket and see how it is. Check the volume, if something all of a sudden had a ton of volume in a single day, you most likely missed it. If you see that it's already raised by a >300% in the passed few months, probably too late and should avoid.

As with all of the positions I listed above, my best advice is if you decide to buy in, pull out your initial investment on a pop and ride the free shares to diversify your portfolio.

If I really had to narrow it down, I would say that  SEEK, MMEX, PLYZ, TBEV, GRST are probably the higher potentials of the list for various reasons.  They are also spread out among different industries to take advantage of portfolio diversity.
As with all of these higher risk plays under a penny, I would suggest taking your initial investment out once the price has moved up, and sit on the remaining free shares.  This eliminates the risk of losing your investment, as well as makes any dramatic price fluctuations a little less painful, as even if the stock went to zero, you still will not have lost any money.",,

My reason for investing was really based around the leadership taking over and trying replicate the story they had over Coach. They operate in a commodity market and there isn’t a whole lot of differentiation other than making strategic acquisitions to take on deeper delivery routes. To me this is definitely a bet, versus a fundamental investment and taking a risk on their ability to turn the story around. If you look at their market cap before the huge drop off from bad prior mgmt’s, it feels the the market lost all faith and this is actually a value play vs growth. For reference I mainly invest in growth stocks and well positioned biotech companies, TLSS just happened to have the right level of risk to reward for me putting up a decent position - long 430k shares.

But in the process of getting to the point of making money, you’re gonna make some bad trades inevitably but they’re gonna teach you priceless lessons on the market and the trick is not to give up despite this. Keep pushing forward and keep studying where you went wrong. Also keep your emotions in check. Think a while before you pull the trigger on your positions and layout a plan for how you want to exit and stick to it.

The truth about OCGN is it’s either going to go to the freaking moon or it will be a painful, firey crash landing. 
Everything is currently hinging on Phase 3 trial results, and we should have at least some interim analysis by the end of this month or sometime next month. If this analysis looks good, the stock will run. Hard.
Next comes the EUA. From what I understand, it would be unprecedented for the FDA to give EUA on Phase 3 data from another country. But we’re living in unprecedented times and it seems like this is what OCGN is hoping for. Of course, the FDA could request additional trials conducted in the US before any kind of approval, but no one knows.

If this is the first vaccine in america kids can use before the fall semester it will be a 200$ stock, that's when i plan to sell right when supply of Covaxin meets the demand of kids needing it to reopen the school system fully and the first step back to normality",,

Several of Ocugen's staff had worked with Bharat researchers while at companies such as Pfizer and Merck — and they had stayed in touch. ""
Here is the story of Ocugen and how they began a connection to Bharat /
While Ocugen has focused on developing gene therapy treatments for retinal diseases since its inception in 2013, the Malvern biopharmaceutical company expanded into a new arena two weeks ago.
On Dec. 22, Ocugen announced it signed a binding letter of intent with Bharat Biotech of India to co-develop Bharat’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate for the United States market.
Since that date, Ocugen's stock price has increased almost 800%, from 29 cents per share to an opening price Wednesday of $2.60 per share.
Bharat's vaccine, Covaxin, received emergency approval from government regulators in India on Sunday.
Dr. Shankar Musunuri, co-founder and CEO of Ocugen, said the two companies are in the process of finalizing a definitive agreement. He could not, as a result, comment on the financial terms of the partnership.
Musunuri did, however, talk to the Philadelphia Business Journal about how Ocugen got involved in the battle against the global pandemic.
""People are losing their lives during this pandemic,"" he said. ""It's unprecedented. These are extraordinary times and people have to make extraordinary decisions.
Musunuri said biopharmaceutical companies around the world have looked at their technology to evaluate what role they could play in developing vaccines and therapeutics against the virus.
Ocugen was no exception.
""When we looked at our team and our network, we saw we do have pretty good vaccine experience,"" Musunuri said. ""So we looked at what we could do.""
That pursuit led them to Bharat, a 25-year-old company based in Hyderabad, India, with a product portfolio that includes more than 16 vaccines and four bio-therapeutics. Several of Ocugen's staff had worked with Bharat researchers while at companies such as Pfizer and Merck — and they had stayed in touch.
""The biopharmaceutical industry is really a small community,"" Musunuri said.
Ocugen had followed Bharat's development of Covaxin. When Bharat began looking for U.S. partners, it started having discussions with Ocugen.
""We felt their technology was pretty strong,"" said Musunuri. ""We wanted to work with this vaccine. … This would be our contribution.""
Ocugen has put together a scientific advisory board to help guide the development of the experimental vaccine.
Covaxin was developed by Bharat in a partnership with the National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research. The vaccine was designed to protect people against Covid-19 by instructing their immune systems to make antibodies to block infections by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
The letter of intent calls for Ocugen (NASDAQ: OCGN) to get the U.S. rights to the vaccine candidate and, in collaboration with Bharat, be responsible for clinical development, registration, and commercialization for the U.S. market.
After the partnership was announced, Dr. Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat, said in a statement, “The development and clinical evaluation of Covaxin marks a significant milestone for vaccinology in India. Covaxin has garnered interest from several countries worldwide for supplies and introduction and we are excited to collaborate with Ocugen to bring it to the U.S. market.""
India's approval of Covaxin generated some controversy, with some questioning the lack of transparency concerning late-stage clinical trial data given Bharat has not yet published results from phase-III studies.
Musunuri said he is aware of those concerns, but attributed them largely to the accelerated review process regulators are undertaking amid the ongoing pandemic.
""The data we have seen to date looks strong,"" he said, adding Bharat will be publishing results from phase-I and phase-II clinical trials in credible medical journals. ""[Covaxin] has generated a very broad immune response, which is important to any vaccine.""
Musunuri said Ocugen's foray into Covid-19 vaccine development will not delay its work on gene-based therapies for retinal disorders.
""Our programs are all going extremely well,"" he said. ""We have one program going into the clinic this year and two others going in next year.""

It already popped and had a great rise. But expecting anything more requires two things:
1) Time 
2) Getting FDA approvals. Even if stuff is phase 3 it’s not guaranteed approvals and sometimes they ask for additional trials for studying.  
Personally I wouldn’t touch it. It’s a gamble on whether drugs get approval and if one fails this goes back down to 3-4$. Phase 3 imo is already priced in. Anyone buying at these levels is flipping a coin. And anyone who had shares for cheap and is up should sell part of their position and keep the rest for the coin flip to at least lock in gains in case bad things happen.",,

EV.V for my fellow Canadians.
ERVFF for my neighbours to the South.
I don’t want to appear as I am pumping the stock, but I will explain why I got in.
This company has a multi billion dollar boron deposit in Serbia, but it’s taken more then a decade and they still aren’t mining.  A litany of issues from the Serbian Government, capital, failed partnerships, a bunch of stuff.  If history is any indication of the future, I should stay miles away.
My best friend has been with them for 10+ years.  Multi buy-ins, multiple losses and a crippling 7 to 1 reverse split that took initial shares of 42 cents to basically nothing.
So why am I investing?  Speculation, which... I guess applies to everything lol.  In December, a LOI involving a company called Temas Resource Corp that could end up in a partnership peaked my interest.  Temas has access to fundraising and capital that could give Erin what it needs and actually take them to production.
That’s enough “pumping” from me, read up on them if you’d like, I think there is a potential but I also don’t know jack shit.  EV is the first (and only) stock I hold and I hope it’s a wholesome experience.",,

Here’s something interesting about the property.
The city it is adjacent to is a coal mining town.  The mine is mostly try but employees so many it’s kept open more as a “charity” than anything else.  Those coal miners could easily be employed at the boron mine instead which is certainly cleaner.
Also, there is a railway right through the friggin city!  Talk about ease of transport.

The coal mine is kept open because somebody wants it open and has the proper connections for it to stay that way. Another reason why your company is not getting aprovall is because workers will be displaced from the coal mine so it is hurting someone else's interests. Or maybe somebody else wants that boron and has the proper connections to put up obstacles. This is the kind of shitshow foreign investors should expect in eastern europe. Lobbying is ilegal in most countries so 'partnerships' have to be made. I wish you luck,,

https://docoh.com/filing/1540615/0001575705-21-000010/PUGE-8K - filed 8-k on the 13th showing Qest's plans

TLDR: gathering a board of members in different sectors. making PUGE the holding company with 4 subsidiaries. Acquiring already functioning businesses that want to go public. Propping them up and making them public. and then apparently potentially making subsidiaries out of thooose subsidiaries?  
https://www.pugettechnologies.com/post/letter-to-our-shareholders - from january but wanted to place this in here as it's confirmation of the slow roll here. Reading the 8-k, you can see their plan to bring on the board members is a year process. So, we're talking 1yr for board and probably 6months-1yr for acquisition announcements after that if i had to guess",,

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .
Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 
Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.
Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .
My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .
You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.
TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 
I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .
The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 
We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 
I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 
I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 
Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .
Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.
I also go to Stocktwits for the same .
Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 
But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.
Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",,

In all seriousness I def am guilty of this, but as a project, I've been intentionally looking at outdated posts to do a post mortem on why the OP or comments were wrong. It's an eye opening experience. When you know why these posts are wrong before you start reading them, you start to realize ""wait a minute OP is taking out of their ass on this point"" or they started with a solid piece of evidence and then got carried away and took it to a super exaggerated conclusion. Or another popular one is cherry picking a really great body of evidence and then completely ignoring something that no one in the thread seems to mention, and only the already biased folks reply. That especially happens when there's strong competition, in other words ""this company is amazing for [list 10 amazing sounding reasons]"" but in reality there's 5 other competitors who all have the same advantages, and it's the bare minimum to compete.",,

Disclosure: my market order didn't execute at $0.44 that I set for open before it took off, so I'm kinda bitter, but personally not willing to pay much more than that when they are still in an expansion phase.

MGX Minerals (MGXMF) had an interesting technology through its subsidiary PurLucid that was really promising.  But I know there has been some upheaval in that company and I can't figure out where that stands.  There was a pilot project in the Eastern US in conjunction with Eureka that was also in later stages, but again, I haven't been able to figure out where that stands.  I think there are a couple others that are trying this with lithium specifically.
The other two technologies for extraction of colloidal metals and minerals from produced water that I am aware of are both private companies and I can't discuss the little that I know about them due to NDA agreements.  What I can say is that there has been a lot of attention on treating oil field produced water in order to conserve water resources and limit the amount that is sent to reinjection wells, and rightfully so.  The panacea is figuring out how to extract the trace minerals and precious metals from that used frack water.  When it is pumped back up from the ground, it has all kinds of valuable goodies in it, but actually extracting those goodies is a major technical problem.  The University of Wyoming has non-profit (CEPWM) that is trying to coordinate the research of a number of players and technologies that I follow pretty closely.  It is a years down the road play, but if anyone ever comes across an investment opportunity in a company doing mineral extraction of oil field produced water, let me know.  I would be very interested. I think it is a major game changer.",,

In contrast fast growing business such as digital turbine (APPS) and Magnite (MGNI) was quite positive on earnings. 
Coming back to pennystocks which are discussed here I think there may be catalysts in the context of earnings. However all the biotech have study results being the catalysts which are not necessarily linked to earnings. All the popular Lithium and Manganese have results from testing drilling etc. as a catalysts which is also not connected to earnings. Therefore I personally do not really care if earnings season is ongoing or not when dealing with these entrepreneur like investments.

Weed is called weed for a reason.  It GROWS LIKE A WEED.  The only reason it's in demand is because it's supply is being artificially restricted by... well the threat of going to jail.  Make it legal and the supply will explode.
Meanwhile, will the number of pot heads also explode?  Nope.  At least it didn't here in Canada when they made it legal.  No line-up at any of the 3 or 4 (or is it 6?) pot stores in my tiny town of 30K people.
So supply goes up, prices (and profits) go down and eventually people will pay for weed at what it's worth - about the same as a dandelion.  You notice a lot of multi-millionaire dandelion sellers around town?",,

In Canada you're limited in each province by how many retail stores you can have. They're just going to hit a certain point where they're at their peak unless they branch out and acquire different companies. Nearly single weed company had a similar run the last month because of news. Retail in the U.S. is already a massively cluttered market by much bigger larger brands and they don't develop their own product.

They have e commerce and delivery but How about you show another weed company that’s grown as much as they had in a short period of time with a positive EBITDA I’ll wait

What's HITIF's net income or operating income? Has it been consistently increasing YOY? Look at a company like Truelieve and you'll see what a long term investment into a weed stock looks like.
EBITDA is massively flawed for weed stocks... A lot of companies use IFRS vs GAAP for a reason. That's why you see a lot of companies in Canada using IFRS accounting because it benefits them massively, so take anything that has to do with weed using EBITDA with a grain of salt.
Weed companies in Canada can use accounting tricks to look better than they are, again I'm not saying its a bad company to invest in but people are hyping it up to make it seem like it can run up to uplisting levels.",,

They are buying more miners all the time and have deployed more recently. They have a lot more to come. They also made a deal recently for green energy supply, which will cut down on their electric bill big time.

Yes, the stock is getting a lot of hype and I see most other comments saying it’s a pump and dump. The reality is that it’s purely correlated to crypto prices. After Musk’s move with the 1.5B, followed by NY Melon bank and MasterCard... you can expect a good number of institutions in the next few months will announce positions in Bitcoin. I personally am still unsure if it’s a bubble or not but regardless the floodgates have opened and with more incoming institutional money there is a high likelihood it will blow through $50k and test $100k at some point this year. SOS will be flying as long as BTC is flying so just look at it as a momentum play. I got in quite late too - around $5.50, but letting it ride. I would put in a small position and most important thing with these momentum plays is trailing stops - I use a 30% trailing stop loss on these types of picks to limit the downside and try and preserve some gains. 
Long SOS and HIVE strictly because I expect institutional money to come into BTC.",,

Do you're research on SOS, bit coin, and ethereum. Buy the dip Tuesday morning after the hype takes it to the moon and hold while bit coin continues to sky rocket.

They had to take on more debt to make it through the pandemic
Theatre demand will be diminished due to some people not wanting to go sit in a room with a bunch of other people got an extended period of time
Streaming isn't going to kill demand for teenage and adult movies, but children's movies are a different story. If you're telling me that for $30 or $40 I can watch the latest kids crap in the comfort of my own home eating pizza that costs less than movie theatre popcorn instead of paying for two kids and two adults to go sit in a movie theatre only for one of us to get up every 15 minutes to take one to the bathroom or go get refills, you bet your sweet ass I will. Oh, and did I mention that children's movies account for 20% of ticket sales? 
You say that someone is going to dominate in the post pandemic market, and I don't disagree, but why people jump to the amc, the weakest player pre pandemic, as being the one leading the pack coming out of this, I don't know. It's far more likely that they are acquired in bankruptcy by another competitor.",,
