If you’re wanting to trade every couple days then consider EMA50 over EMA100 to only look for trades in a current uptrend. If you’re new then I would stick with momentum trading instead of reversal trading but definitely learn when to exit a momentum trade so you’re not buying the top.
Another note, stochastic is better for shorter timeframes. Use RSI for positional and long term trading.  MACD is good too.",,

You’re assuming investment into the 2x ETF at a time when the S&P gained enough to offset the impact of two crashes over time. If investment began immediately before any crash of 30% or more, losses would be too great to be significantly offset over time unless there were no crashes for a long time which leads to pt. 2...
It took the longest bull market in history and fortunate timing of the initial investment to generate a 400%+ return. If a crash were to occur within a shorter timeframe (statistically, close to every 7 years), returns would be significantly lower. Furthermore, with unfortunate timing (i.e. leading up to a crash) returns would either be barely higher than the S&P or depending upon severity of the crash and frequency, below the S&P. Making the assumption that the S&P acts exactly as it did since 2006 from this point on is incorrect.

To combine those points, the ST downside and time it takes to recover from losses would absolutely dissuade big investors who would definitely not want to see a 60%+ drawdown in their investment within a few months. Hedge funds that experience this typically shut down and have to rebrand and start over with new strategies. If they can actually afford to do so, that is.",,

I’m a big proponent of building it yourself. Depending on what frameworks/software you already use, the implementation might be different but since no one has replied, I can try to get the ball rolling.
The way I’d go at it at first would probably create some external tooling that can manage your strategies. I’d think of it as the algo that controls your algos. You have an interesting idea with implementing the average return of an algo and compare it to the return the underlyings. Given that I don’t fully understand what you mean by this, I’m not gonna talk out of my ass about it.
The key to cracking this puzzle definitely relies on the discovering how to quantify this margin of error between the underlyings and the algo’s return, if that even is the right way to go about it.
I’d love to hear other people’s takes on this problem because I’m by no means an expert, nor do I even fully know how to implement what you’re asking.
TL;DR I don’t know. Calculate this difference between the underlyings and algo, then create some external algo that can give you signals when an algo is “dead.”",,

In general, I find using a single benchmark is usually the easiest thing to track and compare your algo against (e.g. SPY, BTC, ... depending on your asset universe). If your algo underperforms your benchmark on one or more metrics (returns, Sharpe ratio, etc.) for an extended period, depending on your trade frequency, it may be time to re-evaluate or archive the algo. What makes this challenging is that there is no cut-and-dry method for doing this evaluation, and it is very difficult to distinguish between a change in the underlying expected performance or a simple unlucky drawdown. Also, it is possible the underlying assets are going through a very lucky upswing which may not continue for the long term, and your algo is better suited for “all-weather”. 
TL;DR, algo evaluation is highly dependent on what the goals of your algo are and what you think is a valid benchmark. Be careful not to judge your algo too quickly as markets are random and hot/cold streaks are very very common and may last longer than you might deem reasonable.
EDIT: Another metric which matters is the temporal decay of your signals. If you heavily use machine learning in your strategies, or trade on very subtle inefficiencies, your temporal decay is usually higher, simply because the signal effectiveness is dependent on other market participants being unaware of said signals. Over time, people discover (your) signals and reduce market inefficiency.",,

I ended up in version compatibility hell across jupyter, python, and npm and they either had bugs or just didnt work. dtale just worked. And it's feature set eclipses the other libraries.

Indicators can absolutely be used for algotrading, but you need to understand how the indicator works and what its purpose actually is. You shouldnt buy when RSI = 90 because that dosnt mean anything. But if RSI is above 90, then maybe its time to look for a reversal, and if you find a reversal pattern, then maybe it has more success rate if RSI is above 90 rather than RSI below 30.. or maybe its the other way aroud, who knows what your looking at and what timeframe.",,

RSI is useful to understand roughly how far through a trend a pair is (specifically on the daily and weekly timeframe) I’ve found RSI generally gets more accurate the larger the timeframe, you don’t want to be trading against the path of least resistance in most cases.

- Are indicators useful at algo-trading? 

Sure, they could be. Or not. Really depends on:

What you're trying to do
If you find something with a stable relationship or any predictive power
If you can actually build a good strategy around it.


- Which topics are good with algo-trading? (I do not ask any strategy, just main topic.) 

Some flavor of statistics, whether it's regular prob&stats, time series analysis, signal processing, machine learning, etc.. Some topics that have been useful to me are:

Different types of time series (geometric brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, etc...)
The concept of a stationary time series
Analyzing the characteristics of a time series (ADF test, Hurst exponent, autocorrelation function, etc...)
Data transformation/normalization
Plain old OLS regression
Probability distributions, histograms, kernel density estimation

I have been diving into dozens of books all of which have contributed to my understanding of this vast topic. I would recommend Random Walk Down Wall Street by Malkiel to start as it a great introduction to the history of financial theory, then Trading Systems and Methods by Kaufman for an encyclopedic overview. Finally I would recommend Trader Construction Kit by Rubano for a funny, concise insight into more advanced trading strategies and the trading industry itself. Then invest manually, that will give you a much better idea of the psychology and pitfalls of trading. If there is anything I have taken away from most of these books it's that the main pitfall for traders is making mistakes from acting out of fear or greed. Yes, your algo may have no emotions but you certainly will! Also it is important to develop a trading philosophy. Do you feel that ""value investing"" is better than ""growth investing""? What about fundamental vs technical analysis? How frequently will you trade? Having a long term view gives you a lot of options that a short term trader can't use. But as you undoubtedly know short term traders can get rich quicker! The down side is they can go broke just as quickly. Read ""The way of the turtle"" by Curtis Faith for some vivid stories about winners and losers and why cash management is vital for short term traders.
I am just getting started trying to learn algo trading myself so I can't give you much insight but it does seem like Python has a much richer ecosystem for machine learning, etc. which gives you a more solid footing for your trading algorithms.",,

All this is good for is guaranteeing you experience the pain of a large drawdown - which in of itself is a good life lesson; but why shoot yourself in the face in order to learn that it's going to hurt? You should know that already, even if you've never truly ""felt"" it.
At best you should be putting a small amount (money you don't care to lose) on a long term investment (indexes, successful long term companies, etc.). However what are you really going to learn by doing this? Long term investment isn't much of an educational experience; it's a simple lesson that most people can already intuit.
2- I find TradingView to be a great interface for manual testing of simple ideas. However the language they use (pinescript) is pretty janky as compared to mature languages like python. They also screw up on simple but necessary things like providing the actual timestamp of an earnings release (as well as upcoming earnings release dates), etc. They seem to be more interested in bringing on tiny brokers (IBKR still missing?!?!?) and fiddling with colours/technical drawing tools rather than supporting the programmers that want to use their platform.
3- Just start using QuantConnect off the bat. I went the bad route of flipping back and forth between QC and TV because it was easier for me to see immediate changes in my forecasts through TV, but as mentioned previously, pinescript is much less capable than python. Especially when it comes to statistics, etc. like volatility modeling, forecasting methods that require p values, distributions, multivariate regression, etc. I'm having a hard time implementing things like GARCH volatility forecasts as there's no library support and community implementations seem to be faulty in various ways.
QC already has good backtesting, and its jupyter notebook setup makes research easier. Not as easy as TV, but if you can get things set up to your liking then you'll be much better off developing in python especially with 3rd party library support. Also I find that QC's architecture lends itself to more advanced development/configuration of your algorithm.",,

WWE dropped their dividend shortly after, also causing the stock price to drop. Palm dropped and eventually got bought out by HP and I held through that to see how it all happened. WWE eventually printed and I donated the stock a couple years ago. All this knowledge that I'll never forget.
Recently bought some options to learn too and learning a lot about option pricing. For example, I bought an OTM PLTR option a day before it expired and put a sell order in for 5x, only to see the next morning that it sold. Never went ITM, but still made money. Weird stuff.

If you don't want to tune your hyperparameter manually, there are two common automated approaches. First, Grid Search is the brute force method for trying all hyperparameter within some defined space. Second, Bayesian Optimization is the approach that may save time searching your hyperparameter space if your hyperparameter space is continuous (a manifold). Both approaches are usually time consuming to run on a machine because they rerun training/testing several times for various hyperparameters.
If you want to manually cut down your hyperparameter search space, you may want expert consultation. Beware that experts are expensive because big tech companies also compete for that talent.",,

So don't get too attached to a strategy, except the learning experience of creating it, and then running it, and then doing it again.
Also, the massive machinery behind the scenes -- capital, risk management, tech stack, execution can't be underestimated.

I don't use trading view but the main way to instantiate a EMA is to take the arithmetic average over the period you are looking at. Pandas just starts at the initial value. Here are two functions to calculate EMA so that you can see the difference. I am using a 20 day period just to show the alpha calculation. Try this:
#Let's start with variable c = ndarray of closing prices w/ 20 period EMA

def EMA(c,n):
    c1 = c[:n]
    c2 = c[n-1:] #convenience
    ema = np.empty(len(c2))
    ema[0] = c1.mean()
    alpha = 2/(n+1)
    for i in range(1,len(c2)):
        ema[i]=ema[i-1]+alpha*(c2[i]-ema[i-1])
    return ema

def EMA2(c,n):
    c1 = c[:n].mean()
    c2 = c[n:].tolist()
    c2.insert(0,c1)
    cs = pd.Series(c2)
    ema = cs.ewm(span=n,adjust=False).mean()
    return ema

Both functions should return the same values. Notice that pandas doesn't necessarily calculate the EMA ""wrong"", it just starts at the initial value. The final values should always be fairly close (or identical) especially as the size of the dataset increases.
This should work, but if it doesn't, let me know.
​
Edit: Updated the code. A mistake in both functions believe it or not. Make sure to set adjust to False in the EMA2 function or it calculates the weights incorrectly.",,

I actually made a mistake in the code and both functions have been updated. Adjust has to be set to false in the ewm call or it calculates the weights differently.
For a bonus, try running a forward and backward pass of the EMA for smoothing. Great for breaking your data up into trends and finding similar assets. Just don't use it for prediction (look ahead bias).
Looks something like this:
#c = ndarray of closing prices
cs = pd.Series(c)

If you have nan values in your c array then you can switch the c1 line to np.nanmean(c[:n]). As for why it's happening: the c1.mean() function returns NaN if there is a nan in the array. When the NaN is set to the first value in the series and it is rolling, it propogates that nan value forward.
Most numpy functions will return NaN if any nans are in an array. There are np.nan___ functions like np.nanmean, np.nanstd, etc. that can handle it. Run x2 = x[np.isnan(x)==False] to drop those values from the array otherwise.
I'm used to a different equation for MACD.

cd = EMA12-EMA26
macd = EMA9(cd)
hisograms = cd-macd

Using the above formula, I would write something like:
def MACD(c):
    def EMA(c,n):
        sma = pd.Series(c[:n]).rolling(n).mean()
        ema = pd.concat([sma,pd.Series(c[n:])])
        ema = ema.ewm(span=n,adjust=False).mean().values
        return ema      
    ema26 = EMA(c,26)
    ema12 = EMA(c,12)
    osc = ema12-ema26    
    ma_osc = EMA(osc,9)
    hists = osc-ma_osc
    results = dict(
        ema26=ema26,
        ema12=ema12,
        osc = osc,
        macd = ma_osc,
        hists = hists
        )
    return results

Your implementation is different but the basics are the same. As far as matching values, check and see how many datapoints they are using.

In my experience, postgres is a much, much larger hassle and in many cases is completely unnecessary for typical datascience.  Unless you need several different users accessing the database and each has different permissions, I haven't ever needed the large and cumbersome overhead of postgres.
Perhaps I'm wrong about this, but everytime I have tried to make APIs with an automated downloading/creating/storing data with postgres, the project sprawls and become difficult to manage, but is much more achievable with sqlite.
Out of curiosity, what types of features does your application have that requires postgres?",,

We don't offer margin (yet?) so everything is fully collateralized. If doesn't matter how far OTM your option is, doesn't matter how unlikely it is for your option to be exercised -- you still have to be fully collateralized. That means if you sold a put, you ALWAYS have to have enough cash to cover the potential exercise, and if you sold a call it could ONLY have been a covered call, and you can NEVER uncover it, even though these are European options.
I do believe you could build a smart contract that offers better capital efficiency. IMO the key would be to natively support spreads, to allow one option position to cover another, like with a vertical spread. As long as you hold both positions, the contract should be able to unlock a good portion of your collateral, while still claiming to be ""fully collateralized"".",,

My project's current formula takes into account favorable (intrinsic value > 0) open option positions held by a trader for decreasing collateral requirements for writing options, so it's a bit more capital efficient in this sense :)

Firstly I was applying it to strategies that were too prone to over-optimisation to begin with and had too many variables.
Secondly I had fixed ranges for the parameter optimisations, there may be circumstances where you want to change certain variables less than others and vice versa but I never tested this.
Thirdly I think it's unhelpful for the same reason monte carlo simulations are. The distribution of data points over the next epoch is almost always different to past epochs.

Make sure to use a binance DEMO account. Approach this with the goal of learning the basics of programming, and APIs. This bot will not make you rich, but it will help you build better bots in the future and it can help you find a job.
Here's how to approach this:

Learn the basics of python - up to you how you do it (undemy, coursera, YouTube, books...)
Sign up for a twitter developer account and follow this tutorial: https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-to-apis/twitter-data-in-python/

The technical hurdle to this is actually very low, the build is straight forward. Your biggest issues (meaning where you’ll lose money) are on the time lag and liquidity of the crypto markets. 
On time lag: large funds that do this for a living will have faster computers and networks than you. Less of an issue in crypto than centralized markets, but I guarantee they have an edge on you. 
On liquidity: The less liquid the market the less likely you are to get an optimal fill, meaning that your gains will evaporate once you move from paper to live trading. 
Hands down though, this is a great way to learn more about trading and programming, but I also strongly suggest using a demo/paper trading account, and not risking your money here.",,

I would transform the sentiment score into a zscore for a stock. You might also want to run the regression for the sector too!
If you have more data I would take a look all stocks and look at the ranks of the sentiment. If you find anything useful you might be able to sell it or work for a fund! 
Also a suggestion is to have a log/csv of historical sentiment over time 
Also I would add great work! Lmk if you ever took a look at that.
Edit: changed from price to return lol",,

This also works for other exchanges and is not limited to Nasdaq.
Basically I look for uppercase words with a length between two and 5 characters. Then I check if those represent Ticker symbols or not. If so, they get added to a list of known tickers. If not, they get added to a list of known not-tickers. I did this to reduce the number of needed api calls.
I'm also computing the Greeks for option data I grab from yahoo and use this to e.g. compute the NOPE score.
For mentioned tickers in comments, I compute a trust score for each author which considers account age and account karma. Account karma will also be adjusted by karma which was gained in specific ""shady"" subs like r/FreeKarma4U or similar. It's also possible to adjust the overall karma to the karma which was gained in specific, given subs (e.g. The sub where the comment was posted)
Ticker mentions in comments will then be weighted according to the authors trust score, or ommited completely if the trust score is too low.",,

It places a limit order at the edge of the spread and cuts in some % periodically up to a price / volatility / % of the spread I specify, and of course as the nbbo changes the order updates to adapt the current spread. You'll need to be careful because they monitor api usage to see who makes a very high number of limit order updates vs fills and they'll cut you off if it's too high. I got a warning about this and needed to make some modifications. putting a minimum on the number of cents between limit price updates solved it for me - for instance I only actually change the order if old price vs new price is more than $.05.
I have a tradier account on standby (and I implemented their api) in case IB ever does cut me off. Tradier doesn't have the margin rates IB does but I talked to their engineering team and they don't care how many limit order updates you make as long as the orders are marketable.

When the concepts are much simpler, a bottom up approach is often used by schools to teach courses. Which doesnt work at higher levels. I would see a formula, recognize that it looks very similar to formulas that I have seen before, but not always realize that it was getting at something different. 
You are probably hung up on what the actual fuck is going on, rather than being too stupid to carry out the algebraic manipulation, which is just memorization anyway. 
Frequently during my classes, I would stick my hand up and ask ""why are we doing this, whats the point?"" ""where are we going with this?"" and I quickly learned to not obsess over the derivations during in class lecture and was sure to take notes in the margins about reason and purpose in order to tie everything in and conceptualize the math in a larger context. I found this sort of top down approach to higher level math could be quiet beneficial. 
The good news is that this is where instructors who can communicate clearly should be able to help you. Dont feel as though you are limited to just your lecturer either, if your lecturer comes from some far away land but your school has a big enough department with many researchers in this field, then you can send an email to other professors and ask them for some of their office hours time, assuming they teach related courses.  Ask them to tie the concepts in to each other, giving reasons and purposes instead of derivations. 
Also, I found stoch calc courses themselves were more difficult than the mathematical finance courses that utilized it, the prerequisites were harder in my case. Financial engineering courses (at least the lower levels) will only require you to dip your feet or maybe leg into the theory instead of jumping all the way in, plus you have real world applications which provide context (such as optimal trade rates), which is I think why many suffer. If you want to get really deep into options (mis)pricing then yes, you have to go deeeep into the stoch calc, which is why phds are required.",,

I am not an algotrader and haven't developed algos for trading either, let alone a successful one, but I am fairly familiar with stochastic calculus for finance. In my opinion, the latter is more important for academic purposes than solving real life problems (maybe not too much for derivatives though).
I believe algos are a lot more technical analysis heavy rather then stochastic calculus. For individual investor decisions, there's behavioral finance involved for the most cases instead of stochastic calculus. It doesn't matter how well you understand stochastic calculus, events like GME are very difficult to explain with classical models - and possibly very easy to pick up by algos.
But the good thing is, if you have the time and dedication, it costs nothing to try and build a few algos and track their performance. Then, you will be able to see yourself if you can build a profitable strategy on your algo. Just be careful with testing and evaluating their performance, because it is very easy to build a good looking algo when the markets are bullish for an extended period of time, like the last 10 months.
This is just my idea though, hopefully someone will correct me if I am being really stupid here :D",,

I feel like math education for the most part is a system designed to make simple concepts as complex and difficult for the greatest number of people possible.

i dont think i necessarily agree, the standard that math is taught at related directly to the universities standard, which vary widely. they are all usually required ot meet a minimum but many go far beyond that. 
what i was trying to get more at is that at the higher levels, its very easy to get lost in the how and not focus enough on the why, even though it can help certain types of learners more quickly and easily come to understand the how. Im going to give a terrible example but its too much eff to come up with a good one, say you dont understand the principal behind arbitrage, then when asked to prove that it does or does not exist, you might struggle to come up with algebra, whilst understanding the concept which is just short overvalued long undervalued could help you come up with the correct answer. yes this is a terrible example. 
I can also tell you from direct experience that yes while some of the top maths programs are dominated by asians, most of them do actually in fact know what is going on, the asian parrot meme isnt really accurate, its just not possible at the highest levels where you can expect several proofs not yet before seen on midterms and finals. you cant parrot a proof youv never read. the parrots dont last in top tier programs.",,

But if you want the actual data: The IEX API Advanced Fundamentals endpoint has both EBIT and EBITDA updated daily and you can pull the real-time or historical values as well as in annual, quarterly, or ttm. The problem you will run into is the IEX api only gives you 50,000 core ""messages"" per month for free. The Advanced Fundamentals is weighted as 75,000 messages per record. But if it's important to you to get actuals vs. approximated then it is entirely possible; but it will just be expensive. I highly doubt the EBIT data is actually updated daily; but more than likely (and for the price) it is updated monthly.

b) EBIT and EBITDA are non-gaap figures so they have some leeway.  Constant currency considerations, or perhaps pre-acquisition impacts.
c) Audit Adjustments (if public these would be in the form of Big R restatements or if less material they would be ""revised"" statements).    
For 99% of companies, adding up the last 4 quarters should work.  Also note that quarterly financials are not audited, and 4th quarter information is typically presented YTD (except press releases), and therefore you do see some ""true ups"" come through from rounding in Q4.",,

So the TTM figure would be:
TTM = Current Quarterly Value + Most Recent Annual Amount - Quarterly Value from 1 Year Ago
If the Annual audited numbers are exactly the same as the sum of the 4 quarters of the year, then the two methodologies are the same. If there were adjustments in the annual number, then you can see differences.
Chances are either approach will be close enough to give you want you need, but you may want to spot check the method I posted here to see if it explains some of the differences you are seeing.",,

Theoretically you coud be having bad backtest & good live performance  but that would probably be a symptom of bad historical data. Let me tell you a story of how I lost my first few $100 in the FX markets.
When I was a lot younger one of my very first software application was a simple EUR/USD forex momentum algo. Backtest performance was fantastic, so I decided to go live, even though I wasn't 18 back then (the sketchy FX bucket shops with 1:500 margin that I used back then didn't care anyway).
5 years of backtests showed at worst 3 consecutive losing trades, my first week, I ran into 12 live consecutive losing trades and only 2-3 winners. I got to learn real fast why latency matters especially for momentum trades.
Some time later, similar strategy this time with faster code & much better architecture & latency I went live again. The result were about break even. Even though latency wasn't that much of an issue. It took me a few weeks to understand what was going wrong. Backtest performance was great but live performance was break even. The issue turned out to be historical data quality.
The platform I was using back then (MT4), only used a couple data points per minute and then generated the second-by-second data through internal assumptions. Turns out my momentum algo, was great at predicting these assumptions (internal for MT4). Totally useless for real market data.
Good data is important.",,

You could manage both of those things very well if you can figure out the standard deviation of the price, or return. A hint would be, if you’ve calculated the standard deviation correctly, the following could be tested on paper trading: stock A has a current price of $100 when you bought it and you estimate the standard deviation is $1. You set a take profit of $102. This should only actually sell 1 out of 20 times in forward testing if it is correct.

The simplicity of your design and using unix primitives if very appealing. Will chew on this. Thanks.",,

Mostly started using RabbitMQ as a persistent job queue when reading directly from the market data connectors. So, the process currently is:

Read off market data websocket
Insert into RabbitMQ job queue
Workers pull jobs off RabbitMQ queue to insert prices quotes/candles into database (postgres) tables

Entirely possible this could/should be replaced by something like Kafka. I built the market data connector module before I started thinking critically about the architecture that would be needed to build the research and live trading environment, so there's not necessarily good reason to use both.
TBH when I started building the market data module it hadn't occurred to me how exactly I would consume live market data for a given strategy/algo. In my head I just generally thought ""ok I'll wire up some sort of pub/sub thing with securities attached to a given algo/strategy and I'll figure out the specifics later"", but then when I started realizing I might want to implement algorithms to aid asset selection, it quickly became apparent that high-level architecture breaks down and doesn't work anymore.",,

I'd equally spaced the prices, because then you know your weighted average is between the last two orders that hit, basically just over the middle between the two. The percentage between each order depends on the volatility of the coin itself. Something not volatile could be every 0.5% for each order, something more volatile could be 1-2%.
The 160 order comes with a trailing profit above it. It means you want to get out of the trade with atleast a profit on the entire amount. It could be any of the orders, the reason I chose about 75% deep is because the coin could be in a downtrend and you still make money. 
Ie
If the coin is heading down, chances are it will have a 1-2% pump for every 5% down. A relief pump. So if it is going down let's say 10%, it will go down 5%, sell all at a 1% pump, then restructure for another 5% down and buy that dip. Then if it goes up, sell in grid up or if another bit down, sell at a profit then structure and buy the dip again. It helps maintain win rate and gets you out of a bad dip at a profit rather than holding at break even for too long then taking a loss because it dipped deeper.",,

3) try GRUs as a replacement as they suffer less from the vanishing gradient problem - they will do better with longer time series with sparse signals

I’ve seen examples as you mentioned (low-ish RMSE or MSE or whatever and almost close to actual prices when viewed from afar). When I zoomed in I saw that it was actually doing a naive forecast and repeating (with some small noise) the current value for the next timestep prediction. From what I could gather this meant that the features I gave were did not carry enough information for the NN to determine any relationship to the price so the network determined that in order to minimize RMSE it should play it safe and just do a naive forecast (as the next price is not that far from the current one). Unfortunately in live trading this is not really how things work so the end result was rubbish.
So you could try and determine the feature importance and see if you need to engineer more of them or play around with different loss functions until you find one that actually cares about the same thing you do (can’t say which, I didn’t pursue this to that degree).",,

I see a lot of people trying to build models with smaller subsets, such as just the securities included in the S&P 500. Having a lot of input data, helps reduce muddy relationships with outliers that can cause problems. It also helps to smooth out randomness (like the GME crap lately) due to the large history. 
The other thing to keep in mind is try not to be too complex, I have made that mistake as well thinking I could build as close to perfect model by being super complex and using a bunch of fields... Simpler ended up being more efficient. Too many input variables for the model just make it more likely you will memorize the noise. 
Lastly, I have a daily reconciliation report that does a bunch of things but one is to check current model accuracy against the rolling 30 day average of model accuracy.

You need to track your nav(net asset value/equity) and your gmv(gross market value/notional position sizes).   If you are long only and unlevered (haven't borrowed any money) then your nav and gmv are the same. But if you have short positions or are levered then your nav and gmv will be different. 
Let's say your frequency is daily.To compute overall portfolio daily returns you need to compute daily nav, then just compute the daily percent changes in the nav. For nav you need to compute notional profits and losses on each position from gmv, then add them up and add that to the nav from the prior period.
For example: say I have nav of $100 but gmv of $200 so im levered 2x. and lets say i have one position. if that security goes up by 10%, then my gmv goes to $220 and nav goes to $120. So nav increased by 20% which is 2 x 10%. Any short position is by definition levered since you borrowed the security to short it - so do the same computation there. Do this for each security each time period then just add the pnl to nav.
This applies to just trading underlying - if you use derivatives (options/futures/swaps etc) then you similarly need to account for the effective leverage the derivative is providing.",,

If your positions are unlevered and if your dataframes have securities on columns, and dates on index then the following will show the progression of your portfolio, for example starting with a nav of 10 million:
starting_nav = 1e7
nav = (weights * returns).sum(axis=1).add(1).cumprod() * starting_nav
note that your weights should correspond to the start of the period for which the returns are calculated, very important. If they are computed for the end of the period then you will need to shift weights forward by 1: weights.shift(1)
Also, different libraries have different conventions around when they will 'trade' to enter and exit positions based on which date they were intended for. You might need to read through the code/experiment to figure it out. That could be why you're getting different results",,

They rebalance often enough and fast enough that at any given time they are very close to delta neutral. They won’t be perfectly hedged at any particular microsecond, but they’re as likely to have a loss from any brief imbalance as they are to make it back with a profit on the next brief imbalance, assuming the market and the incoming orders are uncorrelated.
Although rare, any sustained loss comes out of the profits they make off the spread. If the instrument is really volatile they can widen the spread, enabling them to tolerate larger losses due to net delta.
This situation happens when lots of traders are all moving in the same direction fast. The more random the incoming orders the safer the market maker is, because the less position adjusting they have to do the less time for imbalance there is. That’s why market makers pay big money to get order flow from retail brokers like Robinhood, whose customers they expect to basically be low-information traders acting randomly.",,

You could not implement a pair trading strategy because you were unable to find 2 stocks that were perfectly cointegrated. You then considered arbitrage but you don't have the 100K capital required, nor millisecond access to the market. Sine you are now stuck with pair trading, you decided to fix the cointegration problem.
You are proposing a solution that fixes three problems: 
1) stock pairs are corelated but not cointegrated
a. stock movements are asymmetrical
b. fractional shares are expensive and impractical (how has this been fixed?)
2) flat movement on an individual stock
a. opportunity cost of poorly performing stocks. ie: bad allocation along the Markowitz's Efficiency Frontier (how has this been fixed?)
3) something to do with brokerage fees (needs clarification)
The first problem you fixed is finding cointegrated pairs. You believe that it is not possible to find two companies with cointegrated stocks. Instead, you propose creating a perfectly cointegrated pair by opening long and short positions on the same stock. For example going long XYZ and short XYZ. This introduces problem 1a - stock movements are asymmetrical. XYZ will go up 1% on good news, and fall -5% on bad news. You fixed 1a by weighting the long and short positions. So you go long 1 XYZ and short 1/5 XYZ. This introduced problem 1b - fractional shares are expensive and impractical.
The second problem you fixed is flat movement on an individual stock. Movement is guaranteed if you invest in 200 stocks. This introduces problem 2a - opportunity cost of poorly performing stocks. You believe that investing in the top capitalized companies resolves this. I don't know the reasoning here. 
The third problem you fixed is optimizing allocation into a position. I have no clue what you are saying here:

And you are able trade one leg - stocks with negative or positive values and cut your fee and doing much more profit. As trick you can filter your trade stocks and allow keep in final trade set stocks with values that allow you keep your minimal amount for buy/sell and increase the capital for trading.

I think this is a confusing explanation stating you don't have to sell all the stocks in basket A to convert it into basket B. 
So now you have created 2 baskets, which you are calling ""synthetic ETFs"". One goes up, the other goes down. You have some unspecified magical indicator which you use to determine when to sell one basket and buy the other. This flipping generates a profit (Y axis). Why is the slope not linear? The pairs are perfectly cointegrated. When one goes down by 10 the other goes up by 10.  
Here are my problems:

(1a) The asymmetry for an individual stock is not constant. It changes over time as the price point reverts to a standard mean (mean reversion). It also changes based on the level of ""fear/greed/meme"" uncertainty surrounding the stock. NFLX, INTC, TSLA are good examples.  Uncertainly drops when ""expert analysts"" post their ratings. Uncertainty increases when the company announces news, government announces relief packages, or the economy changes. 
(2a) The larger the number of stocks in your portfolio the lower your returns. I have a 1/2 chance of outperforming the SP500 by randomly picking 5 stocks in the SP500 and pair trading them. You propose buying 2 baskets (400 stocks in total) as pair trading. Whatever the return is, it's going to be diluted by 50% of the basket underperforming.
(3) You assert there will be fee savings because you only sell some of the 200 stocks in Basket A, to convert it into Basket B. This does not matter. What matters is that the profit generated by flipping baskets is greater than the cost. The profit is tiny because it is diluted across 200 stocks. The cost is very high because you have to buy/sell a lot of stocks to flip basket pairs. The maximum number of trades per flip is 400 if you had to sell all 200 in A and buy all 200 in B. In a normal pair it's 2 trades.",,

What I mean is your technical skills/background scope. 

How exposed are you to finance and financial markets you are planning to engage in, along with its infrastructure? 
How abt your programming/coding skills? In which programming language are you gonna write your algo in? Different language has differing advantages and perhaps even differing available and/or well-maintained API library that can make your algo trading coding experience much easier (e.g. python-binance for Binance API, etc)
What'll your setup for deployment of your algo be? Are you gonna do it locally or host it elsewhere? What's your strategy for debugging or periodical maintenance/check-up/upgrade to your algo system should external systemic change(s) to the financial market happen(s)?
 How do you rate yourself in math/stats? While expert level proficiency isn't required, sufficient understanding of math/stats can really go a long way in providing what I like to call ""math intuition"" why certain strategy setups work and don't work, and esp for coming up w/ novel strategies that might provide an edge.

I don't mean to intimidate but tbh establishing a long-running and successful algo trading system by default requires quite a laundry list of techincal skills that are rather high. There's a lot of technical-related learning to do and there's always more to learn. Even after you actually successfully implement your algo system and it makes good money, you still need to at the very least regularly maintain it. You don't just run your algo script and let it do its thing perpetually and not touch it ever again. It's as if your job ""becomes"" an algo trader to a certain extent, so to speak. The extent depends on how much are you willing to let it be or how much your system makes - is your algo making serious cash or it's nice side hustle income kinda thing.
I'm by no means an expert, I'm also still learning and I'm just simply sharing my learning journey so far. Hope it helps and all the best.",,

Well in that case you appear to have a lot of homework to do! You need to start small w/ getting the feel of the financial market you're planning to engage in (e.g. stock market, options, crypto, etc.) so you'll learn systemic workflow stuffs pertaining to a financial market. Then do some research on which programming language you'll write your algo in. I personally use Python due to its ease of code writing. Depending on whether you have a model/strategy in mind, you might also want to come up w/ one or adopt someone else's as initial exercise so once you get the hang of it you can branch out & fully have ownership in terms of your own algo's underlying model/strategy.
Now to answer your question, both are equally important as they both go in tandem. If I were to force it, you could get away w/ 0 math & stats if you can execute other ppl's strategies vis-a-vis able to reproduce them in the form of code (so long it's fully open source too tho, the last thing you want is legal problems for taking other's licensed codebase w/o permission). But it's akin to walking in the dark. It makes it difficult to debug & it becomes truly a black box generally speaking. You're just regurgitating stuff w/o fully understanding what's going on. Can it make money? Perhaps. But it's definitely not the most conducive way to. 
At the end on the day, you need both so you need to study for both. The math & stats are the foundational theory side of things in which you build the kind of algo you want/need and you realize those designs via coding it so you can execute it IRL to (hopefully) make you some money consistently.",,

If a model is profitable today, we may safely assume that the model will continue to be profitable tomorrow if tomorrow is exactly the same as today. However, if tomorrow is different from today, then the performance will change depending on the the assumptions of your model.
In engineering and system design, we say that a system is _robust_ if its expected performance does not degrade due to bounded changes on the assumptions/environment.
I suspect that you want a robust system for profitability. Some simple approaches to improve robustness is to actively monitor the performance and perhaps automate alerts when the assumptions on the environment exceed bounded expectations, e.g. a shift from a bull market to a bear market. By ""retiring"" and diverting your attention away from the model, you are susceptible to these environmental changes.",,

OP has an interesting concept, I have worked on this so to explain your scenario if you put in a limit buy at $10.25 and the algo takes your order, it is essentially because there is a more motivated seller accepting your price & hence eating that spread so there is still a selling pressure in your case.",,

If you have level 2 data it might be easier as you can classify the NBBO relative to existing liquidity:
E.g.

B: $7 x 10000
B: $8 x 500
B: $9 x 1000
[$2 spread]
A: $11 x 1000
A: $12 x 200
A: $13 x 5000

Spreads:

1-1000 shares: $2 ($9/$11)
1000-1200 shares: $4 ($8/$12)
1200-1500 shares: $5 ($8/$13)
1500-6200 shares: $5 ($7/$13)
6200+ shares: ♾($7/no ask)

Now add a $10.25 bid:

B: $7 x 10000
B: $8 x 500
B: $9 x 1000
B: $10.25 x 100
[$0.75 spread]
A: $11 x 1000
A: $12 x 200
A: $13 x 5000

Spreads:

1-100 shares: $0.75 ($10.25/$11)
100-1000 shares: $2 ($9/$11)
1000-1100 shares: $3 ($9/$12)
1100-1200 shares: $4 ($8/$12)
...

You can see the spread is $0.75 only if trading 100 shares or less and that the 100-1000 spread is $2 and someone is crossing it by (10.25-9)/(11-9)=62.5%.
Another way to think about it is that it costs 100 shares to widen the spread to $2 from $0.75, at which point the standing bid is the aggressor.
Another example, on Coinbase (where everyone has L2) you'll see bids at ask - 0.01 or asks at bid + 0.01 and it looks like someone is trying to take liquidity without paying the taker fee. So they are paying the spread but want to avoid the 0.5% taker fee, maybe hoping a higher fee tier trader will pay a 0.04% taker fee in exchange for the true spread.",,

And is not only Crypto’s problem . Institutional investors and hedge funds struggle with the same issue in super liquid markets with fees and spreads of 0,001% . 99,5% of investors trying to time the market will get ripped off in the long term. This is why large hedge funds devote a lot of resources to execution strategies rather than forecasting and even if they find a good forecaster they don’t throw 100% of their liquidity hitting the market (slippage and fees eat most of any potential profit) . The logic is: if there exists a strategy that consistently reap 0,4% trading multiple times a day, that means average market makers are losing money to that strategy multiple times a day. Someone will realize and adjust. Others will catch up. Hence they adjust their bid/offer spreads or client fees  capturing the strategy’s profit. To remain profitable until he long term your strategy should have a larger time frame than the average market maker turnover and go with a longer term trend (one of the reasons momentum strategy work over the long term but fail miserably in periods shorter than 1 month) .

Code above is what I used for trading for last 24 hours for BNB, LTC, ALGO, ETH, and ATOM on Binance.  The parameters get tweaked depending on the Crypto backtesting results, and I'm working on adding more market conditions (e.g. ema6hr is up, ema 2day is down, so short term bullish).  I've only been doing this for a month, so I've got a long ways to go and I've sorta been reading different strategies, throwing ideas at backtesting and seeing what patterns form under various conditions.
Biggest takeaway I've had so far is using stronger/safer indicators and sell thresholds for bearish markets (e.g., greater divergence when both ema2day,ema6hr is trending down) but when things are very bullish, I want to jump in on weaker signals had have a higher sell threshold, and lower bail threshold, since the market is trending up and I'll probably make a solid gain if I just hold through a small 1 hour dip.
The hard part seems to be when long term trends shift from bullish to bearish, where my algo is still buying in agressively but then a long term down trend starts and I get a few bad trades in a row, so I'm working on adding code to hold off trading when ema2day has no substantial up/down trend for past ~2 hours of a bull run. The upside is, that even if I buy on Bullish conditions, if market conditions change, the bail threshold will shift to jump out at 1% rather than hold through a 3-5% dip.
I feel like the 3 key elements are finding the right thresholds for divergence buy-in, sell, and bail based on current market trends is enough to make any algo profitable, its just a matter of dialing in these thresholds.  
I'd also like to make them scaleable, probably using bollinger bands, so if volatility changes, the buy/sell/bail params can adjust also.  Next step I'm interested in is using my code to back test all sorts of combinations of values for the Buy/Sell/Bail thresholds for Bullish/Bearish markets, then dial in the values for optimal daily profit on a 30 day period.  The values would then also get tweaked during trading.
Again, still super new, so I'm probably missing some a lot of key concepts and just learning as I go, but I def prefer to jump right in and put just a few bucks on the line to make things interesting.  The best upside right now to the high frequency trading is it allows me to catch errors in my code on Buying/Selling in real time and not hitting any errors when running 24hours straight.  
Let me know if you have any comments or critique! Thanks so much for the advice, your post has given me probably months worth of insight that I would have found the hard way otherwise!
P.S. Market was super bullish last night, left a lot of potential gains on the table but got about 11$ with each of the 5 bots betting 200$ on each buy in,  I'm still down about 50$ for the week but the scripts had a lot of errors then so I'll just call that cost of R&D lol

Yeah this poster's strategy seems like it might work better if they tried to pick off slightly fewer, but more certain and larger profits at a bit slower rate- maybe dial in solid and steady 1% trades that the computer can more consistently pick off, rather than many more smaller ones that might just be false positives to a really, really sensitive tool.

I'm thinking you're 100% right.  I just really prefer the idea of a constant stream of transactions rather than slower, bigger bets, but it seems like Market Making is the only avenue for that.  If nothing else, it makes things more interesting and feel more productive rather than having my desktop running for hours deciding not to buy in.  
If i really naill down one strategy that performs well for many cryptos I could have it combing through all possible cryptos and use that to drastically up the frequency.  I have it running across 5 right now, and I get about 6 trades a day for the last week",,

The problem with Binance is that it’s a behemoth, and exchange fees is one thing, but the competition is huge. I see often how other bots try to manipulate order book, the most obvious is to place BUY 10000000 order at the end of the order book (only to cancel it later) in order to sell to those who believe this is the beginning of the trend. 
I trade on Kraken, and on not-so-liquid pairs (I don’t touch BTC/XXX pairs, for instance). And it's 26bps taker 12bps maker fees.
On smaller exchanges, and such pairs spread could easily be 1-1.5% of the price, while Binance/BTC it’s 0.0001% or less. On decentralized exchanges it’s even better, because they process all orders in “ticks,” and can lag behind the market. 
In my case, I don’t try to fit both orders within the spread (often it’s impossible due to fees), I just try to keep the volume between my orders at minimum.

If you take liquidity from the book on either exchange, you end up paying a higher fee. Still way less than spot market fees though.

Another thing I forgot to mention, inverse contracts are settled in ex. BTC for BTCUSD, meaning you will need BTC to margin a BTCUSD position instead of USD. So if you plan on trading n pairs it becomes inconvenient as you'd have to hold n base currencies in your futures wallet or convert and pay fees.

And then it must be said, no matter what approach you use it has to be a good strategy, all the programming in the world doesn't do much if your thesis is wrong or too costly to implement!",,

Just hoping to make $500 a day for now

If you're writing on C++, you'll have to work through a broker that'll support your instruments and allow you to connect with either a C++ API they provide, or connect through their web API if they have it. Then you have to actually write code that can receive, manipulate, and store the data from them. And then you have to write an algo, let alone a profitable one.Developing an algo that will 'just' not blow up your account is difficult enough. Don't expect to be making $500/day anytime soon (think about that, ~10k/month, or ~120k/year). If it was that easy every programmer would quit their day job and make just as much, if not more, with automated trades. Being able to code is about a tenth of the battle. Having in depth knowledge of both trading and the market you're working with, to the extent that you can beat simple buy and hold strategies, is the brunt of it. Many algotraders spend years just trying to find a profitable algorithm, so don't expect to write 200 lines of code and suddenly be making six figures.  
EDIT: Forgot to answer your questions:
Still looking into what market I should go into?
Depends on your strategy, funds, etc. If you're trading intraday with <$25k, stocks are pretty much out of the question (Pattern Day Trader requires your account to have >25k to use margin; if you use cash accounts, it won't settle for 2 days so you'll be limited in your amount of day trades; only applies to stocks)
Forex isn't bad, especially since it's extended hours suit automated trading strategies.
Options strategies are a world all their own; I've never delved too deep into them but if it's your cup of tea go for it.
Futures Brokers usually require you be 21 and have a lot of liquid capital (you can lie during your registration if you want, though I'm not advocating for you to do so), but the high leverage allows you to take advantage of smaller market movements.
I believe, simple indicators work everywhere, Cryptos, Forex, Stocks, Futures.
This is true, however slapping an RSI on a bar graph and buying at 30 and selling and 70 won't make you any money. Every market acts and responds differently; you have to actually have a strategy that uses the simple indicators to determine how the market is functioning.",,

so you choose 2 stocks that are in similar sectors, have similar economic fundamentals and similar risk exposures. based on this information, we should in theory expect these 2 stocks to have similar price behavior. 
an example of this is mastercard (MA) and visa (V). since they're identical companies that have similar sectors, economic fundamentals, and risk exposures, we should expect them to have similar price behavior. 
but sometimes they go ""out of sync"" with each other. sometimes mastercard will go up too much and visa will go down too much. this opens up an opportunity for a pairs trade. we short mastercard (since it's overvalued) and long visa stock (since it's undervalued). then we wait for the spread in between these 2 stocks to close as the 2 stocks come back to meet each other again.",,

I don't know, but if the easiness of installing a lib is the main deciding factor for what lib to use, well I am not confident that person will have any success in algo-trading.
One issue with Ta-Lib, that adds more weight when deciding to disregard it, is the precision and accuracy for float numbers. Calculation for Donchian channels is plain wrong for certain Altcoins with very small values like 0.0000000456. This is a know issue with the underlying C library that requires to recompile the C package.

“quantfin” is pseudoscience

Completely agree. But I don't think that's as bad as you're making it out to be. Yes, it will never have the same predictive power as physics, there's no denying that.
But so many other disciplines aren't real sciences and that doesn't make them useless. Oncology isn't a real science, cancer treatment is basically trial and error since every case is different, that certainly doesn't mean that oncology is a waste of time. Of course I'm not claiming studying quantfin is the same thing as studying oncology, but the point is that ""being a pseudoscience"" isn't inherently bad.
Hard science isn't the only valuable human endeavour.

And the thing with stochastic motion: you can’t predict it, don’t waste your time.

This is where you're wrong though. You can't predict a coin flip either, but you know that it's a 50%-50% event.
Same goes for stochastic processes, you can't know where the process will go. But, for example, you can get the probability of it being greater/lesser than X. That's not a ""waste of time"" because knowing the probability of an event is valuable.",,

Probability is complete nonsense, you think it does anything for you to know that a coin is heads half of the time?

If you are betting on it, I'd say it would be a pretty useful piece of information.

It is ridiculous to model a very large complex system where you know all the variables, let alone a system where you don’t even know all the variables, such as the market.

Welcome to statistics. That's pretty much the whole point of this discipline.

2. You will have to lose some money while learning from the strategies you choose. 
3. A good mentor with years of experience can help a ton. Honestly you should work in finance a little just to get your head straight and learn first hand.

I understand what you mean, but any branch of mathematics can be applied. For instance, I have risk models that use a harmonic oscillator instead of volatility and return distributions due to a background in chemistry.
For some reason, a sports analogy is all I can come up with so here it is: say someone says, ""I want to play a sport, what do I need to do?"" Even stuff that seems general, like strength and conditioning, may not be. Strength is pretty straight forward but conditioning varies a lot. Swimming is a lot different than running which is a lot different from wrestling. To get started, you have to have some idea of what you want to do.
If you are planning on sticking to retail trading, I recommend looking into subjects like portfolio management, pairs trading, and option strategies focusing on theta/vega. Long term strategies are much more approachable (and more likely to be successful long term for retail traders).

I am reading the incoming data and writing it to the DB using a queue and a consumer to read from the queue and write to the DB. 
I am at the same time, in another set of threads going to send that same message to my strategies that will use in memory pandas data frames.
My reasoning is that I want to save each message as it comes in so that I can replay them later in the system to rebuild strategy worker state or prime a new strategy when it starts. I don't want this to slow down the time it takes for the message to get to the strategy, so I send it directly to the database and the workers at the same time. This way there is no read delay for the workers.

Traditionally, people have found java to be reliable here although I find python,c#, js (node) based approaches to be equally reliable

Personally I use Typescript + node.js. My backend is mostly a nebulous mess of my own code and random libraries I lifted off of NPM. I picked node for the promises and async functions which make it easy to write performant request code that works with the various APIs my projects interface with. Plus Node-gyp for integration with native libraries and TFJS for ML.
Honestly though, I think the best approach would be to use a blend of tools that work well with the individual parts of your pipeline. If you want a (mostly) single-language stack, don't use Ruby or some other language that doesn't have any mature, well-maintained packages for doing data science/statistics work unless you want to roll most of your own stuff.  This implies using Python though (in most circles), since you'll likely find that rolling your own stuff gets in the way of what you actually want to do.",,

Somethings that might contribute to the discrepancy: 
The OHLCV data for each individual provider is likely slightly different, so it stands to reason that the parabolic SAR calculations are slightly different as well. 
Parabolic SAR is also calculated recursively, using the previously calculated SAR value to obtain the next. It's unclear how a lot of these platforms track their SAR calculations. Some might have calculated the values since the beginning of their ticker history, some might approximate it at the beginning of the period you're viewing. The length of history each provider has on record to use to calculate is likely different as well.
If you're seeing very large discrepancies that aren't related to the different OHLCV data, there might be unreliable calculations, but you should also ask yourself how reliable you need them to be. Parabolic SARs is valuable to recognize trends and possibly set stop losses. 
Are the up trends and downtrends you see with each provider roughly matching up? In my experience they normally are, despite a few cents difference in the quote data and calculation.",,

I will try to explain things here briefly. The whole motivation behind this was to spend less time finding good options to trade. I usually run this code manually, look at the top 3 choices, and place a buy order straight away under less than 1 minute and go back to work.
This is written in python. Tickers are obtained using scrapy on Finviz. I use the Yahoo options endpoint to fetch the data. The TA is performed on the daily data. B-score is a set of checks that I have in place, e.g., if RSI is less than 35 then it gets 1 B-score. Similarly, I have other checks on IV, Bollinger bands, etc., which worked well and are tested over time. You don't have to put in too many checks. Some simple ones just work great.
The ideal buy sell column is the price you want to get a call and sell it. This is derived again using all the TA factors. I have never seen a call rated 8/8 so far. Any score >=6 will end up in profit with a very high success rate. I usually don't hold calls for more than 3-4 days.

I have backtested similar type of TA-combos (bollinger percent B is one of my favorites in combination with very simple SMAs and RSI) on long stock positions during 2007-2009 and some other chaotic time periods and the strategies still work. You just have to compound 1% or so on the stocks that the machine tells you to buy and keep taking profits out during those kinds of chaotic time periods (aka dont be greedy and take profits as soon as they come to you). In bull markets you can be a bit more greedy. 
Also, I would look into doing similar types of analysis on intraday and interday vix-related etfs... you would be surprised to see how high the winning percentages are.

I am in the process of building out a complex momentum trader for crypto right now, using some of the same type of logic you are (minus the options specific indicators).  Starting with crypto because I’m also learning to code and it’s a little easier to learn the backend parts with the crypto exchanges.  But once that’s up and running and successful, I’m definitely going to be turning my attention to options and building out some sweet strategies there.

How often do you have limit orders placed according to your ideal buy that go unfilled? Do you ever push your order a couple of cents higher to increase the fill chance, even if this caps your earnings? Or do you just consider that a missed opportunity, rescan, and try placing a new limit order with the current highest-rated contract?
Same question, but for selling the next day. How often you have your sell orders go unfilled? Do you ever lower our sell price by a couple of cents to increase the fill chance? In this case, you can't just move on to another contract, since you already own it, so you gotta sell it at some point.
Do you have a preferred time of day to run your analysis and place your orders? Have you found a difference between doing it at market open, mid day, and near market close? Since the volume number resets daily, I assume you are generally running your algo somewhat later in the day, otherwise, very few things would be over 100 volume.",,

Once order is placed, it keeps checking its state whether confirmed or filled. If not filled for a preset interval, it's cancelled. Interval is 10 minutes. Plenty of other options to chose from so I don't bump up the price. You can have your strategy here depending on your preference e.g. if bid ask spread is large enough to accommodate your profit, you can bump up the bid price. 
I sell next day for now because I need to avoid day trading as I play with limited capital. After the buy, code quits for now.

This is live since November on real money and I don't change any parameters either. It works pretty much very well on all sorts of conditions.

I don't check charts anymore and I blindly trust whatever ends up with score >=6.
Manual trade execution for now to avoid day trading. Buy today and sell tomorrow works. 
Those who are trying to replicate this, I will suggest to do real time testing for 2-3 months instead of back testing, and fine tune your strategy in real time. This will give you more confidence in your approach since you don't know the future outcome in real time. With back test, you already know the past and one can get biased in the selection of parameters during fine tuning.
I did real time testing for 5-6 months instead of back testing. And there is a lot more which is not mentioned here in this discussion. One example is to remove tickers after the scanning which had recent insider selling. All the framework mentioned here is just a base framework which will get you started and build something powerful over time.",,

Your point is valid. Robinhood won't accept the bid of 0.17 on a call which has 0.05 increment. Those ideal buy sell values are raw computed and are not rounded of based on the call incremental value. I will fix that, it's in my To-Do list.

I would personally do this in order to see if the algo is universal or performs better in bull/bear markets. Then you could adjust your modifiers to account for the deficiencies, rerun, and see if it performs better in markets it didn't before. Rinse and repeat.

It is just the historical fine-grained data that has no values for volume. Have you experienced this problem with the historical endpoint on the Robinhood API?
The problem with having no volume data from the Robinhood historical endpoint is that I cannot calculate VWAP based on it. I'm not sure what else I could do to calculate VWAP in this case, other than to calculate it based on the daily data from Yahoo. But VWAP is supposed to be applied only to fine-grained intraday data not daily data. And I cannot just ignore each option missing the volume data from Robinhood because that means I have to ignore every possible option contract.",,

I am not doing this and this is just a suggestion for your problem. Robinhood api doesn't give volume at all that's why I don't use it for historical and hence for TA.
Other suggestion would be to fetch historical from both and fill up missing values from each other. I don't encounter these problems because I don't do short term calls. Your call is deep in the money and probably less people are trading it. Therefore the data is less. I just ignore such calls if TA can't be done due to missing values. Hope that helps.",,

IMO, to assume long term success by modeling any algo only during bull periods is a dangerous game.  The duration of your trade type really does not change that, because a short term trade can be initiated during any market condition.  And while you are 100% correct that past performance is no guarantee of future performance, the less data you use for any modeling endeavor, the higher your probability of erroneous conclusion.  I am in no way knocking DJ's approach. Perhaps, by its nature and design, loss control is built in.

That's totally fine. Human nature will always be involved in your approach.
But you are missing the point here. This is a system/framework that streamlines many things specially your time. I did only two trades, spent less than 2 minutes, and I am up 33.56% on the money I started my Monday. That's the beauty you have to appreciate. There is no luck involved. This approach gives you filtered quality trades which are guaranted to give you high probability success rates with in seconds. There is nothing else to do literally.
Again, make money by whatever path you choose. A gain is a gain. The only difference is that you are probably working way too much for it than you are supposed to.

PMs generate ideas, oversee risk and generally manage the process,  quants do the actual research and take the strategy to the ""finishing line"" and frequently also supervise the daily operations of their specific strategies and developers are working on the infrastructure side of things.

I say this as a quant who studied mathematics. 
Most quantitative funds in the high frequency space are doing some of that but the technical advantage beats the better clustering approach. The stats is there but nothing you won't be able to pick up in 2-4 months on your own and then, depending on the topic you're working on, read on the side. 
Then there is the high to medium frequency stuff. Here you're looking at larger market makers who are not necessarily front-runners but are really great in modelling market microstructure. All that ML stuff and data science stuff you keep suddenly hearing about in the last 5 years, they do this since 20 years but took the time to work out the theoretical statistical hard facts about those classes of methods. Most of what you hear in also advanced data science classes is very much focussed on getting you to apply some standard method in 3-6 months, it's a lot about ""business value and how to deliver results to clients"" and all that stuff. Noone cares about that. It either works or it doesn't and it is up to you to know why exactly you can use a Heston model as a prior for your flatbook execution structure class. That requires an understanding of deep theoretical statistics and other related fields. Noone gives a damn about your Jupyter notebook and Docker deployment stuff there if there is no mathematical reason your assumptions translate into observations. A blackbox model that works is fine if the black box is really, really small but for this you need the mathematical capabilities to keep it small. That is something data science does not provide, at all. 
Now I'm not done yet, there is still the low-frequency stuff, wealth management and so on. Those might actually profit from this to some extend to get some economic insight. Robo-advisors could profit from some data science knowledge to calculate the week's capital allocation (or even daily, who knows). Also reporting teams in risk departments can profit from this if you have a talent to represent data nicely - on the other hand, don't expect to really dive deep into financial microstructure, because the same people there like simple reasons. 
You're an undergrad, valuable exposure will be to be good at basic parametric statistics, classic financial mathematics, be good at programming and be able to understand and communicate effectively. 
From experience I can tell you that the everything-is-a-blackbox-that-just-works approach that a lot of data science and ML folks are trying to fish in financial companies for will not catch on for at least 10-15 years. Folks tried with 'big data' 10 years ago and the data science hype is already dying down partially because people realize that predictions without insight do not make much sense. Also big financial ML proponents like de Prado are talking about very specific stochastically well-defined classes of models if you read closely. 
So briefly, for finance, yes, take some. For algorithmic trading etc, likely a waste of time. You're simply not getting the required mathematical depth in there.",,

Your first sentence sounds idealistic. You'll see that as long as your bonus does not depend 100% on it, it won't be that important. It's just as valuable to present your idea that would have made money just to make the other guy think you're smart than to actually implement that idea. Corporate world is really a whole different level and unless you're not really owning the book you're trading, it won't be that important. It starts from people behavior, what happens if your idea makes your boss look more stupid that you? You'll be surprised how much of a factor that can be in 99.5% of the places you might end up in. 
In the end you can still work on interesting and important topics without necessarily finding the world formula.

Topic-wise, yeah that's a bit speculative. Always good if you know your way around option pricing, so having a project there is cool but also standard. 
Depending how mathematically strong you are I'd advise you to dip your toes into BSDEs ultimately. I think you might be missing a bit on the analysis side of things so feeling comfortable with function spaces and so on but I personally see a lot of numerical movement happening there in the next 10 years - very applicable to investing, better option pricing and so on. The topic has many touchpoints with optimal control theory, with that you would look at superreplikation strategies of option portfolios if transaction costs are involved for example. This is still tractable for 1D but for higher dimensions this goes bonkers, BSDEs have been shown to build 'deep learning like' solvers for very high-dimensional HJB equations (a nonlinear PDE, also connected to optimal investment processes).",,

Nowadays if someone sees or hears about a company that interests them, often times they will do a little research as a due diligence to silence their negative thoughts and boost the positive outlook of stock performance. After that most of which will jump in from there. Your next tier investor may do his research and understand the industry plus the possible future growth as well as check 52 week ranges and P/E ratios but not much else. Third tier investors I would say do the above while also checking charts, past performance to future outlook. But there is a lot of simple investors out there right now barely grazing stock fundamentals investing in stocks. Lots will lose a lot of money being so simplistic but lots will also profit from jumping in on the bigger picture without little resolve as some finite investors analyze to such an intensified complexity that they hesitate and miss price targets or exits. 
My strategy wavers depending on the type of investment I will be making. From day/swing/or long term investing. They all hold a little different criteria but still have the same foundation. 
No matter what 
Always look up the company website 
Always look up past and recent news 
Find possible catalysts 
Make sure the company is going to be going in the direction you want at the speed and security you want.

My system is able to take gigs of historical prices, calculate technical indicators, preprocess the data, train models, and then backtest those models by simulating a portfolio trading from 2015 to 2020. If the backtest looks good, then I implement it in an automated trading script that interacts with TD Ameritrade to make the trades each day based off the day's predictions. Each of these steps individual is all automated, but I have to initiate them manually. The auto trading does run continuously without any intervention. I've tried to design it to handle daily and minute stock price data, option data, and hopefully in the future, futures data. 
What I've written from scratch are a lot of the data preprocessing that gets done, like data augmentation and class balancing, but of course I use sklearn to make things easier. Also a lot of the portfolio metrics like alpha, beta, CAPM, sharpe ratio, etc, are easiest when written from scratch too since they're just formulas that output a score that you can use to know how well the models are performing. The backtesting is all written from scratch instead of me using backtesting software. This gives me the flexibility of determine how the model's outputs should best be traded, although the backtesting has probably been the biggest headache since it's so easy to introduce a bias. Whether it be a look-ahead bias, an assumption bias in what price orders are filled, and more. I've had times where a backtest looks great for 2 months until I suddenly realize where I introduced a bias that needs to be handled, then there goes 2 months of time wasted on trading an algorithm that had an inaccurate backtest. 
I definitely think it's possible to get to a point where it adapts to changes in market conditions. That can be accomplished by just continuously training the same models on new data as time goes on. I'd be wary of automating hyperparameter tuning, since that can easily lead to overfitting, so manual tweaking is probably inevitable in that regard.",,

Backtesting simple models is essentially hyperparameter tuning, except the ML algorithm is replaced with a human. A human can come up with decent performance solution faster, sure, but also remember you might be backtesting and refining over 6 months. ML theoretically could be faster, being able to refine a great model in a couple days. But in practice you do still have to play around with the ML hyperparameters based on the dataset.

Also just curious, do you use python with pandas + jupyter and that jazz or do you use a different setup? 

Python with a library that gives you tons of indicators to test (personally, I use this one: https://github.com/bukosabino/ta). Pandas is used but just to set the data, nothing fancy. I don't use Jupyter, I go with the simple IDLE that comes with Python installation but this point doesn't really matter, just go with the most comfortable for you.

The size of the jumps will be determined by historical data for the particular asset. The S&P will have smaller jumps than a really volatile asset, etc. A lognorm would be a reasonable choice. You could also use KDE depending on how well the distribution fits.
The Poisson distribution will give you a number of jumps based on a probability by sampling the quantile function. When you are running your MC simulation, you need to draw from a uniform normal for each of your paths and then compare those values to the probabilities drawn from the Poisson dist (eg. np.random.uniform() >= 1 - poisson dist value.
Make sure you are basing your volatility on the intraday returns and not using something like GARCH or MCMC on end of day returns. Price jumps will affect the volatility values if you are using end of day returns in the volatility calculation.",,

You will notice the natural log of the prices is much more linear than the actual prices. With a GBM, because you are using a constant drift term, you are essentially assuming a linear (degree 1) trend. Using the log returns will give you a more accurate distribution much of the time.
After you fit your distribution, you want to switch back to simple returns.

Don't know what you mean by level2 types. But I'm fully aware different solutions will create different strategies:

Hidden Markov - I would expect that I get the current hidden state of LOB and calculate the probability of moving to another state. If the probability that the next state of LOB is the state I associate with change of the price - I execute order.
In RL - of course the Agent should maximize my profit (after fees) by taking decisions itself on past image of LOB (and tradebook of course).
All supervised ML methods - I created labeling function as per De Prado (described here) and I need to match the label.

​
About the tick data,  few points:

I always like to get more granular data as it can be aggregated later, but the opposite operation is not possible
Tick data I transform to LOB images from which later I'm deriving own features (I think they are meaningful like calculating which side ordered Market Order - was it ask or bid initiated trade?)
Because I have downloaded literally everything that could be recorded, I can really precisely estimate my slippage and incorporate it into backtesting. I will know if my order could be even filled or not (was there a counterparty offering such transaction for a given price). I trade futures and stocks, not CFDs. Furthermore, I think this is really important advantage on day trading where the ratio of fee to volatility is really high, so getting relatively high fee PLUS not considered slippage could cause the algorithm to fail. 
From my data I can anyway create whatever OHCL I want (with additional information)
and most important - this is what API provides

​
Why do you think I don't need such detailed information?",,

Actually I thought exactly about it. I mean, shouldn't ML detect spoofing and icebergs? That how I have imagined Neural Network to work.

Also, the market today is very different from the market you're optimizing for. China stocks had huge drawdowns due to investor ignorance and trump but that fundamentally changed last year. So any portfolio you make from backtesting is going to have very little China exposure even though Chinese stocks are best positioned to have low drawdowns in the future simply due to Chinese macroeconomic fundamentals. 
And that's just one example of how you're overfitting. Commodities are also very different now from any time in the past decade.
Instead of backtesting, invest in a strategy. Backtesting only tells you how well you would have done five years ago. Not how well you will do today.",,

Here is the C# code:
var client = Alpaca.Markets.Environments.Paper.GetAlpacaDataStreamingClient(new SecretKey(API_KEY, SECRET_KEY)); //You get keys when you make an account

the dataset API generally makes syntax nice, eg:
# find houses with 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, and newer than 1990s
results = houses.find(
            bedrooms = 2,
            bathrooms = 1,

pyfolio was mantained by quantopian, a hedge fund which no longer exists. The library likely will not be updated going forward so if you want to use it you will likely have to patch it yourself as bugs arise.

All that said if you install yfinance via pip (```!pip install yfinance``` in colab) then run the following you should get the result you're looking for:

That's interesting for sports betting ETF, from my understanding it is essentially a bunch of options but I read it's often mispriced.  I'd imagine the difficulty would be knowing the probability better than the over sentiment to play that well.  I'll have to read up on what this betting ETFs underlying is to understand more too.

It doesn't really have a focus on building useful software. There are a few things that are helpful (building simulations and heuristics are useful) but to someone else's point you cannot optimize without a strategy.
Edit: this is a long way of saying the DS is more useful not really that you cannot learn it online. With MOOCs you can (that's how I am). It's a bit harder to learn from youtube IMO",,

Seriously, though, my approach is using RL for the actual entry signals, essentially using the same indicator as in a regular bot but having the network learn the entry signals to look for instead of calculating them.
However, so far it has not been successful which is mostly due to the layout of the network since the indicator does provide good entry signals with the parameters over the given period.",,
