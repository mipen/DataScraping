Multiple trillions will enter and while much will seek safe stocks like big tech or whatever, much will go for more speculative boom/bust sectors...Why? Because there's no comparable sources of return out there.  Everything else looks like crap compared to stock returns right now.So it's not worth blowing up your account chasing one bubble when the next is just around the corner.  None of these are once in a lifetime opportunities, they aren't even once in a year opportunities.  There will be many more to chase as long as you still have money in your memefolio.Always focus on the next one and be willing to turn the page if you watched one run but never pulled the trigger.  If you were watching RIOT at $5 or $10 or $20 or $40, then $80 isn't the time to get into it."

Robinhood restricting trading, causing a huge wealth transfer back to Melvin and the other shorts. But I believe Robinhood was a smokescreen for what's really going on.When we squeezed the hell out of the hedgies, they weren't going to just sit and take it. We know that 40% of Robinhood's revenue comes directly from Citadel Securities clearing our retail trades. Recent litigation from a couple months ago shows us exactly how the system works: Robinhood makes money from routing our trades for shitty execution at these clearing houses.But what happens when the clearing house is about to get hit hard by a short squeeze on their hedge fund arm? The one lever they have is the capital requirement firms like Robinhood have to meet/deposit to clear through them.Vlad gets on TV and tells us that the clearing firms were asking for hundred of millions in deposits from his firm, driven by volatility. While Robinhood could cover, they had no idea how high these requirements would get and panicked. And rightfully so, because Citadel Securities blew the capital requirements out of control.The brokerages didn't make these decisions because they wanted to, they made them because they HAD to.Now the political and media madness points a cannon at Robinhood and the real story remains hidden. Don't be fooled. The hedge fund establishment took back billions and suffered barely any blowback. They're happy to see Robinhood and others go under for their own personal gain.TLDR for the crayon eaters: Robinhood was used by Citadel to take the fall while the hedge funds took back billions"

According to the DTCC website firms can see the VAR and collateral requirements hourly through their portal - the whole story stinks.There is NO WAY that retards from robinhood had enough positions at stake to a) Require 3 billion in collateral or b) Justify Robbin the hood to ban GME share purchases. The reality is Robinthehood had to cover all the call options that WSB retards held by buying them on the open market - to avoid them losing a lot of money they simply stopped letting anyone else buy. The reality is there was never 3 billion at risk because that would require billionaire hedge funds to hold multimillion dollar positions with Robinhood which we all know doesn't happen. Robinhood also claims only 3% of their clients use margin which makes the whole thing even more BS.Due to member requests, new features have been added to the interactive NSCC Risk Client Portal and API. In addition to the existing functionality, the enhancements will allow member firms to review 15-minute intra-day slices instead of hourly slices to monitor fluctuations in VaR and exposure to help anticipate potential intra-day margin calls. NSCC is also extending slices past 4:30pm, until 7:00pm, to allow for a better forecast of next-day risk clearing fund requirements.To further enhance transparency, DTCC also plans to release the detailed algorithm of its VaR formula within the portal for clients to consume providing the ability for client in-house replications of the NSCC VaR formula within their applications. This will be made available within the next coming weeks.As an element of NSCC‚Äôs overall service, the Risk Client Portal‚Äôs simple interface empowers firms to make better decisions for their portfolios, utilizing real-time insights and historical trend analyses. The risk monitoring dashboard provides an at-a-glance breakdown of risk exposure, as well as 30-day trend lines that highlight key metrics such as total risk requirement, volatility and more, so firms can be proactive in making risk management decisions. With the VaR (Value at Risk) Calculator available in the portal, firms can create their own ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios to model changes to their portfolio and instantly see the resulting risk requirements."

After it crashed, I fought with myself for days thinking, what the hell is wrong with me, why wouldn't I sell when it was 480, why am I so greedy? But it wasn't greed, not entirely. It was calculated. We did the research, we had the DD, we knew the numbers and all the evidence told us that the squeeze hadn't squoze at 480 and it was about to absolutely fucking launch into andromeda. AND. WE. WERE. RIGHT. Then they turned the game off.So if you ever feel down on yourself in this situation, try to find some comfort in the fact that we were indeed making the right play. This guy admits it himself. Everything we worked for was at our finger tips. Never forget what these mother fuckers robbed us of."

She continues, Even the wider market effects potentially attributable to the GameStop phenomena, like the dip in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were mild and short-lived.And remember that the dude in the video said this to some Media. Ms Schulp will be reading the above into sworn Congressional Testimony tomorrow.Berkshire Hathaway stock is like $370,000 a share. Lindy & Sprungli AG $8,887. Amazon is $3,237. There's plenty of space for the stock market to handle stocks in the thousands, tens of thousands, and even hundreds of thousands. GME going to those ranges would have done nothing negative to the market, as leftover assets from imploding HFs would be gobbled up by other HFs as they went bankrupt (see also, every single fucking time the market does crash - the things that bankrupt just get eaten by bigger businesses).This dude is simply a rich fuck trying to make Retail out to be a bull in a China shop and the Rich out to be a steady hand on the market. He's talking like he's going to bat for us, but I'll take the sworn testimony in bold above over anything some rich fuck goes on MSM to spout off.Edit /u/Jb1210a makes a good point that also shows this rich dudes BS doesn't pass the smell test: If it was so dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system, why the hell didn't Fidelity (and other brokerages) disable the buy button as well? I was using TDA and rode it up, able to purchase without a problem. Obviously TDA and Fidelity didn't think GME purchases were gonna collapse the whole system lol. Please, if you learn nothing else, remember not to take anything that rich Boomers say at face value. They're always hiding an ulterior motive, and they do NOT have your best interest in mind until they've put their money where their mouth is.Edit 2 ITT: People who can't cope with the fact that the rich shut the money off out of self preservation, and instead want to believe it was shut off for the good of the entire American economic system. Don't let the rich deal you Copium."

Considering even sales weren't properly going through at times for some people, they were completely and utterly screwed over by RH. Will this mean RH goes under? Probably. Good..

It won't.. Yes, in reality there are multiple trading platforms, some people are still holding, multiple stocks screwed over (I held a few of em,) and the timing of buying them probably would matter too. If I really wanted to break this down into minute details as desired reparations for a lawsuit I could, but that's the job of actual lawyers.

Their fuckup was so monumentally disastrous that, had the game not been shut down, they would have blown up the financial system in a way that would have made 2008 look like a walk in the park. We have this guy, on air, outright stating that they would have had to deliver 270M shares. There are only 50M in existence to be traded. They would have had to buy every share in existence then do it again 4.2 more times. Every single time they purchased all of the shares to return to their rightful owners, they'd have to by their own rules, go back into the market and beg these same people they just returned shares to, to sell them back so they could return them to someone else. And they'd have lost everything to do it, and when they had nothing left, the Citadels would be on the hook, and then the big banks. And none of them were getting out of it because these were their own damn rules. They would have had to mass liquidate their other holdings absolutely tanking the rest of the market in order to fulfil their obligations on GME. We were going to potentially see losses in the TRILLIONs. Hundreds of millions was going to be the bare minimum. All because these stupid fucks got caught with their dick in the jar."

I am not a hedge fund. I donot have clients, and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions. Iam an individual investor. My investment in GameStop and my posts on social media wereentirely my own.I did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for my own profit. I did not belong to anygroups trying to create movements in the stock price. I never had a financial relationship with anyhedge fund. I had no information about GameStop except what was public. I did not know anypeople inside the company, and I never spoke to any insider.As an individual investor, I use publicly available information to study the market and thevalue of specific companies. I consider a complex array of factors and track hundreds of stocks ‚Äìall in search of market inefficiencies. Like many people, sometimes I post on social media mythoughts and analysis about individual stocks and whether they are correctly valued.I did that with GameStop. I believed the company was dramatically undervalued by themarket. The prevailing analysis about GameStop‚Äôs impending doom was simply wrong.A little about my background: I grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts. My father was atruck driver, and my mom a registered nurse. I was one of three kids, and the first in my family toearn a four-year college degree when I graduated from Stonehill College in 2009, amid the GreatRecession and without a long-term job. My first post-college job was in operations at W.B. Mason,an office supplies company headquartered in my home town of Brockton.1¬†Between 2010 and 2014, I worked for a family friend at a start-up company in NewHampshire, trying to build a software program that would help investors analyze stocks and offerrelated research. We also tried to start an investment firm, which dissolved not long after it wascreated. My salary never exceeded $40,000, but I did learn something about investing. I learnedhow to do the tedious work of digging through a company‚Äôs financials and focusing on its reallong-term value, not prevailing market sentiment or headlines.I married my wife Caroline in 2016, and I found a job working operations and complianceat LexShares. I left that job in March 2017, and for the next two years I was effectively without ajob. During that time, I began actively analyzing a wide array of stocks to try to keep and increaseour limited savings. It was both a way to make money and an interest that I pursued passionatelywhile I lacked a job.In April 2019, I accepted a marketing and financial education job at MassMutual. Carolineand I were both happy about our prospects. I had never made a salary over $100,000 a year before,and I was thrilled just to be working and to have benefits again. My title was Director, FinancialWellness Education. My job was to help develop financial education classes that advisors couldpresent to prospective clients. I never sold securities, and I was not a financial advisor.I continued analyzing stocks on my own time and investing my family‚Äôs funds. In earlyJune of 2019, the price of GameStop‚Äôs stock declined on worse than expected earnings, and itbegan trading at a deep discount, below what I thought was its fair value. I was aware from publicreports that a well-known investor, Michael Burry, was interested in GameStop. Because I thoughtthe stock was undervalued, I purchased call options on June 7, 2019. I increased my positionthroughout much of 2019 and 2020, because as I continued to analyze the company and its2¬†prospects, I became increasingly confident that the share price was indeed dramaticallyundervalued.Two important factors, based entirely on publicly available information, gave me and manyothers confidence that GameStop was undervalued in 2019 and 2020. First, the market wasunderestimating the prospects of GameStop‚Äôs legacy business and overestimating the likelihoodof its going bankrupt. GameStop, the only major retailer dedicated to gaming, has over 60 millionmembers in its loyalty program and continues to maintain a sizable market share within the gamingindustry. Its legacy business, comprised primarily of selling physical video games and relatedequipment within their stores, was likely to generate meaningful cash flow following the releaseof new gaming consoles in late 2020. I grew up playing videogames and shopping at GameStop,and I‚Äôm looking forward to buying a new console at GameStop. I knew the company had anopportunity to reinvigorate this business by improving customer service for gamers, upgrading itsonline presence, and offering complementary product lines such as PC gaming and accessories.Second, I believed ‚Äì and I continue to believe ‚Äì that GameStop has the potential to reinventitself as the ultimate destination for gamers within the thriving $200 billion gaming industry. Thenew console cycle provides GameStop a unique opportunity to pivot from a traditionally brickand-mortar mindset toward a technology-driven business that excels in gaming products,experiences and services. By embracing the digital economy, GameStop can pursue new revenuesstreams including larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, onlinetrade-ins, streaming services, and Esports. While I may be the only panelist here today who hadfaith in GameStop, I was hardly the only person who advocated these points or ones like them.Investors including Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, whose purchase of GameStop shares and3¬†advocacy with the GameStop board helped positively affect the share price in late 2020, publiclyexpressed similar views.I want to pause to note that the investment I made was risky, but I was confident in myanalysis, and I was willing to accept the loss if I was proven wrong. My timing was far fromperfect, and many of the options contracts I purchased expired worthless because GameStop‚Äôsstock price remained depressed longer than I expected.I‚Äôve been asked why I decided to share my investment ideas on social media. Myinvestment skills had reached a level where I felt sharing them publicly could help others. I alsothought that by sharing my own ideas and accepting critiques, I would be able to identify holes inmy analysis. Hedge funds and other Wall Street firms have teams of analysts working together tocompile research and critique investment ideas, while individual investors have not had thatadvantage. Social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and WallStreetBets on Reddit areleveling the playing field. And in a year of quarantines and COVID, engaging with other investorson social media was a safe way to socialize. We had fun.The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors ispreposterous. I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and thatmy aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out thechannel. Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis ‚Äì myfocus was on the fundamentals of the business. It‚Äôs worth noting that after five months ofstreaming, my final stream of 2020 topped out at just ninety-six concurrent viewers, with anaverage view duration of twenty-five minutes. On Christmas morning I had only 529 subscriberson YouTube, and 550 followers on Twitter. These numbers are tiny. There were rarely more thana few dozen folks on the stream on any night. The reality was people didn‚Äôt really care about4¬†boring, repetitive analysis of GameStop and other stocks, and that was fine. For those of us whodid care, the stream provided us an outlet for refining our fundamentals-based thesis. We wereable to analyze events in real-time and keep each other honest.Ultimately my GameStop investment was a success. But the thing is, I felt that way inDecember far before the peak, when the stock was at $20 a share. I was so happy to visit myfamily in Brockton for the holidays and give them the great news ‚Äì we were millionaires. Thatmoney will go such a long way for my family. We had an incredibly difficult 2020. In additionto dealing with COVID, we lost my sister Sara unexpectedly in June. It brought me tremendousjoy to share good news with my family for a change. I am grateful to be able to give back to mycommunity and to support my family, most of all my wife Caroline who has stuck with me throughvery tough times.As for what happened in January, others will have to explain it.Threshold lists, orderflow, halting purchases ‚Äì according to the media these all had a material impact on GameStopstock in January. Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve had a bit of experience and even I barely understand thesematters. It‚Äôs alarming how little we know about the inner-workings of the market, and I amthankful that this Committee is examining what happened. I believe an analysis of GameStop‚Äôsrecent price action must start with a discussion of the exorbitant short interest in the stock, as wellas an investigation into any potentially manipulative shorting practices and brokers‚Äô reportedfailures to timely deliver shares and settle trades.As for what I expect moving forward: GameStop‚Äôs stock price may have gotten a bit aheadof itself last month, but I‚Äôm as bullish as I‚Äôve ever been on a potential turnaround. In short, I likethe stock. And what‚Äôs stunning is that, as far as I can tell, the market remains oblivious toGameStop‚Äôs unique opportunity within the gaming industry.5"

Seriously?  Did they even check out his youtube videos?  Were his YOLO updates manipulating people to buy the stock?  NO.  That's is rubbish.  The man deserves every penny he made off Gamestop and probably more with all the sketchy actions that took place to halt its progress.  DFV actually believed in the stock, for WAY longer than most people on WSB who bought in for the short squeeze. Maybe take a little more of a look at the hedgefunds trying to short the stock into its grave and brokerages straight up removing the ability to buy while leaving the ability to sell.  Those behaviors seem a bit more questionable than a guy buying a stock and sharing his logic for doing so.  If Congress finishes this review and believes DFV is the problem and not other players in the GME game, then I don't know what the hell they're thinking."

Average Joe finally saw that it is indeed possible to make money playing on the market,, and it is possible to at times, win. Those guys who got in early and made money, that scares the fuck out of those twats, because it's the opening of a new door. Theres alot of people who watched it play out, or heard about it, read about it, and the more and more it's out there,  even with an improper narrative, the part of, some guys made alot of money, whether alot to you is 1k, or 500k up,, it showed it was possible to play their game, and have success..knowing hedges took a loss, and had their sacks smashed a bit, well that was just pleasant. So, wsb went from 1.5, to what, 8mill people in a week or two? That's alot of people.  If they didn't infiltrate and get on defense, just imagine how many more would have joined.  So, I do feel like there's way more people than we can even imagine willing to help open the door, and at least push back and try to show more people it's possible, and they are as crooked as ever. I think this is the beginning of something new. I don't know what the fuck it is, far too retarded for that.  All I know is I can't fucking stand watching people just skate by rules while blatantly fucking over every company an person they so desire. Historically extractive institutions end up ruining countries until some sort of real bad shit goes down. They aren't gonna just stand by either, they will push back, and do everything they can to continue making money"

When you sell calls, the buyer has the right to exercise (just like you when you buy an option).  Say I had 100 shares of GME at $100, $10k value.  I sell 1 call for say 1/29 $160, and price shoots up to $400 on 1/28.  Like what happened here.  The buyer says, fuck yes, I want those 100 shares @$160 now, because it‚Äôs worth $400 each already, and exercised their option.  The option seller now has to sell their 100 shares to the buyers at $160.  So the seller made $6k (bought 100 @ $100, sold 100 @ $160) plus premium but lost out on additional profit of selling at $400.  But you still make money.But if you are like this dumbfuck, you sell $200k worth of call options without owning shares, then when the buyer exercised, you don‚Äôt have the shares to deliver.  So you are forced to buy them.  So dude had to buy @ $400 to acquire the shares and sell back at $160.  All loss.

It‚Äôs called covered because you would only sell an amount of calls equal or less to the number of shares you own in that security. You collect income for writing the call and take the risk that the call ends up in the money. But, you have an equal number of shares actually owned, so any amount the call is in the money is offset by gains in the underlying shares you own. It caps your upside at the price you write the calls at, since any losses above that call price would be offset by gains in the shares you own. Naked calls is selling a call without owning any shares. So you‚Äôre responsible for any losses above the call price. If stock goes up big the losses can be significant. Google the strategy, it‚Äôs pretty straight forward and good if you‚Äôre okay accepting capped upside."

This thing was clearly in a squeeze the day it popped over $60. All the ensuing action was driven by fund money, not by /u/DeepFuckingValue, who opened his positions months and even years ago. These morons should be suing Jim Cramer and CNBC for giving /r/wallstreetbets so much coverage. Cramer was already talking about wsb in December, and this Yahoo Finance article dated January 13 specifically mentions GameStop as a wsb target. The stock opened at $20 and closed at $30 that day.This is just lawyers capitalizing on the publicity of the incident. Fuckin' scum. The plaintiff they've chosen is a dumbass whose greed and fomo led him to make a stupid options play and lose over $1 million to hedge funds. And now they're targeting /u/DeepFuckingValue? Unreal. Rule number one of any bubble is that at any point it can always go a lot higher than you think. If you're dumb enough to sell naked calls on a stock going parabolic, if anything you should be suing your brokerage and/or the market makers who allowed you to make such a stupid play."

If we have people buying a share per put, WSB can easily create a situation where there are no shares to short, especially if everyone opts out of the broker borrow program. This way they can't just sell the share you just bought back to you. They will have to create FTDs in the system to maintain their liquidity requirements. As well as using puts to force MMs to have naked short shares on their books.Selling puts and adding 1 share per put is probably the best way to handle this situation.This allows people to keep powder dry, take profits and buy more shares.I think this opportunity just became a siege situation and not a quick play.If you add to your DD pick how much money you are willing to spend and sell the put that directly correlates to that amount that would be great.My disclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only.

The short juggling shenanigans surrounding the ETFs, combined with the persistent and desperate FUD, suggests that likely many of the original shorts are still intact, but simply hid their positions to fool the bulls into thinking they closed. In other words, they nearly collapsed last time, and if the price rockets to that point again they have a good chance of being margin called. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see retail driving another bull run, since they‚Äôre burned out from the first effort, but there‚Äôs a sea of whales out there. I want to be positioned to capture the waves. The open interest (and continued daily volume) on 800c options for 2/19 and 3/19 is quite interesting.I agree though that the long-term prospects under Cohen‚Äôs leadership look rosy, and squeeze or not I‚Äôll be in it for the long term."

Your capital gain is short term -- taxed at your marginal rate -- since you never owned the stock. If the stock price has dropped to a few pennies per share as the year ends, you might want to recognize the gain before the new year, even if the firm is not yet formally bankrupt -- you don't want the good folks at the IRS accusing you of delaying payment of your taxes.

For every 100 shares you own, you can sell an option. The IV means implied volatility, which if it's high means options cost more. OP is implying that things aren't as volatile anymore, but people are paying for options as if they are. Ergo, selling an option that isn't likely to be realized will get you some decent money. It's still very risky, and you shouldn't do it if you don't understand it. Don't think I do, I don't.Keep in mind, when you're selling options (as in making the options instead of trading the options for money) things are a little backwards. When you buy 1 Call option you can execute to buy 100 shares, but when you create and sell 1 Call option you might be forced to sell 100 shares at the option price. So looking at OPs example, he created and sold a put option that forces him to buy 100 shares for $7000. He was paid $4200 for someone else to have that right. If the option expires and the price for GME is more than $70 he made free money. If the price for GME is less than 70 then he will pay $7000, but it will only cost him $2800 because he has the $4200; and if the price for GME is greater than $28 he can still sell those shares for a net profit."

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting from this: 1) Hedges over short GME 2) Retail buys GME to force a squeeze on shorts and now very ITM options 3) GME price peaks, not because of squeeze but retail demand trying to get in on the game 4) Rather than hedges doing what they are F-ing supposed to, which is actually buy the stocks to cover shorts and ITM options, they just say ‚Äúsorry, retail has all the stocks and their too expensive so we‚Äôre just not gonna buy right now.‚Äù I know nothing of the fines for this, but paying the fine is probably cheaper then covering their positions at that point. 5) Since hedges are just failing to deliver and not covering their positions, GME price settles down because retail has bought all the appetite they could afford/Robinhood BS/paperhanded BS. 6) As days pass, hedges continue to just ‚Äúfail to deliver‚Äù and so demand/price remain low 7)Continuing to keep it low by failing to deliver not only keeps üíéüôåüèª from getting their juice but it also continues to push more and more options OTM (remember when the highest option was $90). So it seems like if the hedges were forced to cover, not only would they have the losses of already failed to deliver contracts to answer for, but that demand would have also caused a multitude more options to have been ITM over the past couple weeks. So failing to deliver feels like a manipulation of the market demand to also keep future options OTM as well. So many of those holders are also being cheated out of earnings by this continuous fail to deliver.Do I have all of that right? Or am I just a typical ape brain."

While the popular narrative is that retail traders rose up to target hedge fund short positions, we do not have the data to know what portion of GameStop‚Äôs rise was attributable to retail investor behavior versus the behavior of other market participants. More so, we may never have the data to determine the diverse motivations of all the individual investors who traded in GameStop.But some things seem clear. Importantly, the temporary volatility in GameStop and others did not present a systemic risk to the functioning of our markets. As the Treasury Department recognized, following a meeting with officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the market‚Äôs ‚Äúcore infrastructure was resilient during high volatility and heavy trading volume.‚Äùhttps://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-schulpj-20210218.pdf‚ÄãSounds like the potential of crashing the system has already been ruled out."

Maybe giving them better legal rights than human beings is too far the other direction ;)I am indigenous myself, international law is a fantastic thing, but it is very difficult to learn because even common law schools don't really teach much of it, ex cept from the point of view of their own domestic interests.For example, they don't teach white people that they're able to asert their own nationhood, says so in the UN Charter, everyone has the right to acquire a nationality, the state offers you their nationality, you can build your own.  IMO things like doing a land title system are now easy, like, the power of the 19th century Torrens System wa that it centralized records---now anyone with a $5 VPS can create a land title registry that is more accessible than any 19th century registry you had to visit in person.The registry is a record of facts, it's not the facts themselves, and if you are a nation, not a treaty person, there's no reason you cannot create your own land records.  But of course the Crown doesn't tend to teach indigenous people this in law school, they try to focus them on things like hunting/fishing.Also, they all want benefits, if they're status, so they don't really want to be completely independent, they still want to harangue government for money if they need a water filter, etc.  my nation never made any treaties, we buy our own food and water.

It means that to reach that number, they're using different accounting methods than the ones they're legally obligated to make. I'm not saying that in this case its the end of the world, but its an important statement because that number shouldn't be compared to the GAAP number that comes from other companies. I can only say that I personally disagree with the idea of using value relative to the rest of the sector as a benchmark, and share my reasoning. For one, it assumes, as a strategy, that the sector is priced the way it is at least in part because of value metrics, which as we know isn't always true. If the sector you're comparing against has bubbled because people are hyped about it and are betting on the companies they've heard of, then the valuation metrics don't really mean anything. Betting on a company with price to sales ratio of 7 because the rest of the market is at 15 ignores the probability that the whole sector will correct. When that happens in my experience the less popular companies get hit harder. Actual value investing, like what deepfuckingvalue does, is looking for companies with metrics that are actually good value, not just relative to a sector that's gone off the deep end. Usually it involves finding companies that kind of bum you out but have surprisingly good financials and an attractive price tag. They're still out there."

Car loan) the once you pay it off and if you can afford to.. keep that money out of play. My car was $650/month and when I paid it off I set up an account in Ally and did monthly deposits of $650 to that account so it was like forced savings. You can even do an index fund and invest that money monthly. Now when I buy my next vehicle I have a healthy amount to put down and also not worry much about monthly payments 2) Try to always pay off you CC in full monthly and if not just try to stay on top of it.3) with each raise/promotion, try to keep your expenses pretty flat and see if you can throw even a fraction of that into savings or increasing your 401k contribution.I‚Äôm by no means a financial advisor but these little tips has saved me over $100k in the last 5 years. Living inside your means and reducing going out to eat and making food at for an example will add up in a really positive way over time. Best of luck to you!"

That's the banks (and all the other related companies) collateral. By law it has to be posted at the DTCC and they get shares in return. Kinda like how they technically have shares of the Federal Reserve, but don't actually control it. As for what the hell happened since 2007 when they didn't have authority. I mean...gestures at 2008. The ability for clearinghouses to change capital requirements on the fly as risk their risk models update? That's a direct result of the global financial crisis in 2008.

This is literally the regulations everyone and their mom insisted we impose on the banks to limit risk doing what they were designed to do. I guarantee the banks hate it more than you do.

In that as the price of GME mooned, hedgies would have been margin called, leading to their long positions being dumped on the market. This loss in value of various long positions would have caused some long only funds to start getting margin called, which when that happened we would have seen a chain reaction of explosions in a lot of the funds possibly even Fidelity, Blackrock and Vanguard. The most interesting thing about this situation is as GME mooned and good stocks crashed, GME and other meme stock holders would have been in cash, which would have been a huge transference of wealth across the markets.More interestingly though is the fact that with the sell side bias on trading, is the amount of options that went OTM. This would have forced so many shares to be short that theoretically we could have seen 30 to 40 million FTDs on a single stock after that day. Which would have been rather interesting when those came due.My disclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only. I am not a legal, tax or financial professional.

Assuming the spike took it to well over $1000 a share, let's say $1800 a share. Thats still only $176 billion. The S&P 500 is worth $33.5 Trillion. Meaning a 1% rise in the S&P 500 would totally dwarf the extreme scenario in which GME reached $1800.

In 2008, Lehman got screwed because of shitty mortgage backed securities, and when they went belly up, it caused a chain reaction.  It required a bailout to save the market.  This time, hedge funds got caught naked shorting, heavily levered, and some were about to go belly up.  This would've caused a chain reaction also, and who knows what would've happened.  We already had a bailout from the crash last year, and this could've had a huge impact because the money printer is already running.  Maybe I'm imagining too much, but I'm sure there will be consequences down the road."

That's their first problem - a zero-down margin for everyone (and a standard 25% down margin for larger amounts).In normal operations some of your customers are buying $STOCK, some are selling $STOCK, at the end of most days Robinhood probably owns roughly the same amount of $STOCK as they did at the start (*I don't even know where to look to see if that's true). But Robinhood had a heterogenous customer base that happened to be all going in on the same stock, and nuts. In GME times, RH had half of their entire userbase buying GME and very few selling, so they had to go to DTCC and buy the stock for all the transactions. As the stock went up, that meant their highest debit to DTCC went up way over the normal amount for the day. That's their second problem, and that one wasn't their fault.So at close of market Wednesday, DTCC looked at the debit RH had that day, looked at RH reserves, looked at WSB buying in no matter the price, and imagined the stock barely even going up, hitting $500 and RH users still buying it all day. There were 100million shares traded on Wednesday. RH has 13 million users. Let's say 500,000 of those users initiated a bank transfer and used that automatic margin loan to buy 5 stocks@500 on Thursday morning, and that all the other transactions cancelled each other out as in normal conditions. (*Remember, I haven't the faintest idea what the actual nets were). At close on Thursday, RH owes $1.25billion. Will RH really have that money ready, thinks DTCC? Hmmm. And imagine if it really did rocket to $1000 AND presumably add a smaller debit of the same kind for AMC, BB, etc - wow, that could be a $3billion debit pretty easily!  HMMMMM. Even if you only rate $1k as a 1% chance....So after that scary thought, they tell RH they need to put up $3billion by market open, to prove they'll have it there at market close if rockets, and surprise! they don't have that much cash on hand. And we haven't even talked about all the RH users who were actually trading on margin and might not even be able to pay the rest if they get called. I wrote this story for myself in crayon, and some of it may not be true because I don't know how this stuff works, check out my sweet GME@310."

Those are margin calls based on Robinhood's internal risk department. So when you trade on margin  you have to maintain a minimum amount of equity. Losses come out of your equity, the broker is just providing leverage. So when the losses get too high that Robinhood's money lent to you as margin is at risk, they issue a margin call and start liquidating those positions until you're back to the right ratio of equity to margin. (You can also just deposit more cash, but I'm guessing if you're buying fractional shares on margin, that's not really an option. Also Robinhood isn't really known for their customer service when it comes to margin calls and working with the client)"

My argument is that it was coordinated by the clearinghouse. Only a few brokers put true halts on purchases. Most brokers (larger ones such as fidelity) did not and just made users pay cash collateral for their trades. My suspicion is Robinhood got its margin call (which tbh, they should have been able to model out themselves if they had a proper finance department), which is has mentioned above includes a VaR calc. VaR can be calculated a couple of different ways but it‚Äôs function is to show the minimum expected loss x percent of the time. Using its simples method, it‚Äôs the the average value minus its volatility multiplied by a set number of standard deviations to get your confidence (likely 2.33œÉ, for 1% VaR). I would guess RH said they‚Äôll limit the trading on an extremely volatile asset to lower how much they would have to post. If this really was as coordinated as you mentioned, they would have blocked all individual brokerages and the hedge funds would just sold through either dark pools or their prime brokers like the normally do. You do not run a brokerage without a risk department that will model the daily margin calls. Saying you don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs calculated is honestly irresponsible on RH‚Äôs side."

My point is: logically it does not make sense for DTCC (the clearing house the a good amount of the financial industry) to go out of its way to pressure only a few retail brokerage companies into stopping the trading on a few highly volatile asset. My standing is RH, and other smaller brokers, halted out of their own inability to pay their margin calls. I believe IB also halted, but their CEO did it himself. What I would love to know, is why you believe that this was a coordinated attack on retail investors? As you must know from your studies, a lot of firms have blown up much bigger than those involved with GME."

My pops grew up with nothing, then played a pro sport and worked as a bond trader. We were always raised to understand that any higher education we wanted to pursue, he would pay for, but beyond that, if you want something discretionary like a laptop or a car, you work for it. And that he would spend his last dollar on the day he died. He retired early. Couldve kept working for the pay, but he was just fine living a modest life and spending time with his kids. I knew that we were well off and would never be destitute, and that's great. And he knew he had a better situation entering the workforce, so he wanted to make it easier on us by removing student loans.It was that confluence of situations growing up that allowed me to be cognizant of this trade, understand it, and see why it is right and just. I think it is much the same for your friend. If he was raised like a normal billionaire's kid, he wouldn't even have bothered to make the trade. And his father wouldn't have given him even 7k to fuck up the status quo if he was a standard billionaire"

The hope there is that he can make great money and pay it off relatively quickly.  The problem is he spends money like he does not have that debt, and it scares me for him.

Her parents see their money as their money and we agree with that sentiment.  My white privilege was gangs trying to kill me for the fucking color of my skin, while there are people who get something from it not all do.  Get off your ass and do shit instead of making shit bag assumptions."
